abstract = {Intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ ([Ca$^{2+}$]i) dynamics were studied in identified rat gonadotropes using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in conjunction with Indo-1 photometry. The kinetics of depolarization-induced [Ca$^{2+}$]i transients vary with Ca$^{2+}$ load. In addition to a rapid initial decay, large (> 500 nM) [Ca$^{2+}$]i transients have a slow plateau phase. Application of the mitochondrial inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) significantly slows the decay of [Ca$^{2+}$]i transients, consistent with stopping uptake of Ca$^{2+}$ by mitochondria. CCCP causes a small increase of [Ca$^{2+}$]i at rest. After a large Ca$^{2+}$ entry the amount is much larger, consistent with release from a mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ pool that fills during cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ loading. The rate of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by mitochondria is dependent upon [Ca$^{2+}$]i. Consistent with previous studies, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) induces [Ca$^{2+}$]i oscillations. The mitochondrial inhibitors CCCP and cyanide (CN-) terminate these oscillations. The mitochondrial ATP-synthase inhibitor oligomycin reduces the frequency and increases the amplitude of the oscillations. In the presence of ruthenium red (a non-specific blocker of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$-uniporter) in the pipette, GnRH does not induce rhythmic [Ca$^{2+}$]i oscillations. We suggest that mitochondria play a significant role in the rapid clearance of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ loads in gonadotropes and participate in GnRH-induced periodic [Ca$^{2+}$]i oscillations.},

abstract = {Ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) produces spatially and temporally defined Ca$^{2+}$ signals in several cell types. How signals received in the cytoplasmic domain are transmitted to the ion gate and how the channel gates are unknown. We used EGTA or neuroactive PCB 95 to stabilize the full closed or open states of RyR1. Single-channel measurements in the presence of FKBP12 indicate that PCB 95 inverts the thermodynamic stability of RyR1 and locks it in a long-lived open state whose unitary current is indistinguishable from the native open state. We analyzed two datasets of 15,625 and 18,527 frozen-hydrated RyR1-FKBP12 particles in the closed and open conformations, respectively, by cryo-electron microscopy. Their corresponding three-dimensional structures at 10.2 A resolution refine the structure surrounding the ion pathway previously identified in the closed conformation: two right-handed bundles emerging from the putative ion gate (the cytoplasmic "inner branches" and the transmembrane "inner helices"). Furthermore, six of the identifiable transmembrane segments of RyR1 have similar organization to those of the mammalian Kv1.2 potassium channel. Upon gating, the distal cytoplasmic domains move towards the transmembrane domain while the central cytoplasmic domains move away from it, and also away from the 4-fold axis. Along the ion pathway, precise relocation of the inner helices and inner branches results in an approximately 4 A diameter increase of the ion gate. Whereas the inner helices of the K$^+$ channels and of the RyR1 channel cross-correlate best with their corresponding open/closed states, the cytoplasmic inner branches, which are not observed in the K$^+$ channels, appear to have at least as important a role as the inner helices for RyR1 gating. We propose a theoretical model whereby the inner helices, the inner branches, and the h1 densities together create an efficient novel gating mechanism for channel opening by relaxing two right-handed bundle structures along a common 4-fold axis.},

abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors are tetrameric intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ channels, the opening of which is regulated by both IP(3) and Ca$^{2+}$. We suggest that all IP(3) receptors are biphasically regulated by cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$, which binds to two distinct sites. IP(3) promotes channel opening by controlling whether Ca$^{2+}$ binds to the stimulatory or inhibitory sites. The stimulatory site is probably an integral part of the receptor lying just upstream of the pore region. Inhibition of IP(3) receptors by Ca$^{2+}$ probably requires an accessory protein, which has not yet been unequivocally identified, but calmodulin is a prime candidate. We speculate that one lobe of calmodulin tethers it to the IP(3) receptor, while the other lobe can bind Ca$^{2+}$ and then interact with a second site on the receptor to cause inhibition.},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ -induced Ca$^{2+}$ -release (CICR) from ryanodine-sensitive Ca$^{2+}$ stores provides a mechanism to amplify and propagate a transient increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]i). A subset of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture exhibited regenerative CICR when sensitized by caffeine. [Ca$^{2+}$]i oscillated in the maintained presence of 5 mM caffeine and 25 mM K$^+$. Here, CICR oscillations were used to study the complex interplay between Ca$^{2+}$ regulatory mechanisms at the cellular level. Oscillations depended on Ca$^{2+}$ uptake and release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Ca$^{2+}$ influx across the plasma membrane because cyclopiazonic acid, ryanodine, and removal of extracellular Ca$^{2+}$ terminated oscillations. Increasing caffeine concentration decreased the threshold for action potential-evoked CICR and increased oscillation frequency. Mitochondria regulated CICR by providing ATP and buffering [Ca$^{2+}$]i. Treatment with the ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin B, decreased oscillation frequency. When ATP concentration was held constant by recording in the whole cell patch-clamp configuration, oligomycin no longer affected oscillation frequency. Aerobically derived ATP modulated CICR by regulating the rate of Ca$^{2+}$ sequestration by the ER Ca$^{2+}$ pump. Neither CICR threshold nor Ca$^{2+}$ clearance by the plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$ pump were affected by inhibition of aerobic metabolism. Uncoupling electron transport with carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl-hydrazone or inhibiting mitochondrial Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange with CGP37157 revealed that mitochondrial buffering of [Ca$^{2+}$]i slowed oscillation frequency, decreased spike amplitude, and increased spike width. These findings illustrate the interdependence of energy metabolism and Ca$^{2+}$ signaling that results from the complex interaction between the mitochondrion and the ER in sensory neurons.},

abstract = {A calcium signal is a sudden increase in concentration of calcium ions (Ca$^{2+}$) in the cytosol. Such signals are crucial for the control of many important functions of the body. In the brain, for example, Ca$^{2+}$ signals are responsible for memory, in muscle cells they switch on contraction, whereas in gland cells they are responsible for regulation of secretion. In many cases Ca$^{2+}$ signals can control several different processes in the same cell. As an example, we shall deal with one particular cell type, namely the pancreatic acinar cell, which is responsible for the secretion of the enzymes essential for the digestion of food. In this cell, Ca$^{2+}$ signals do not only control the normal enzyme secretion, but also regulate growth (cell division) and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Until recently, it was a mystery how the same type of signal could regulate such diverse functions in one and the same cell. Recent technical advances have shown that different patterns of Ca$^{2+}$ signals can be created, in space and time, which allow specific cellular responses to be elicited.},

abstract = {The release of mitochondrial-intermembrane-space pro-apoptotic proteins, such as cytochrome c, is a key step in initiating apoptosis. Our study addresses two major questions in apoptosis: how are mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins released and how is this process regulated? Accumulating evidence indicates that the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) plays a central role in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of VDAC1 controls the release of cytochrome c, apoptosis and the regulation of apoptosis by anti-apoptotic proteins such as hexokinase and Bcl2. Cells expressing N-terminal truncated VDAC1 do not release cytochrome c and are resistant to apoptosis, induced by various stimuli. Employing a variety of experimental approaches, we show that hexokinase and Bcl2 confer protection against apoptosis through interaction with the VDAC1 N-terminal region. We also demonstrate that apoptosis induction is associated with VDAC oligomerization. These results show VDAC1 to be a component of the apoptosis machinery and offer new insight into the mechanism of cytochrome c release and how anti-apoptotic proteins regulate apoptosis and promote tumor cell survival.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide and is at present, incurable. The accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) peptide aggregates in AD brain is thought to trigger the extensive synaptic loss and neurodegeneration linked to cognitive decline, an idea that underlies the 'amyloid hypothesis' of AD etiology in both the familal (FAD) and sporadic forms of the disease. Genetic mutations causing FAD also result in the dysregulation of neuronal calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) handling and may contribute to AD pathogenesis, an idea termed the 'calcium hypothesis' of AD. Mutations in presenilin proteins account for the majority of FAD cases. Presenilins function as catalytic subunits of $\gamma$-secretase involved in the generation of A$\beta$ peptide. Recently, we discovered that presenilns function as low-conductance, passive ER Ca$^{2+}$ leak channels, independent of $\gamma$-secretase activity. We further discovered that many FAD mutations in presenilins results in the loss of ER Ca$^{2+}$ leak function activity and Ca$^{2+}$ overload in the ER. These results provided potential explanation for abnormal Ca$^{2+}$ signaling observed in FAD cells with mutations in presenilns. The implications of these findings for understanding AD pathogenesis are discussed in this article.},

abstract = {While the fundamental metabolic function of calcium is to serve as a second messenger, coupling intracellular responses to extracellular signals, nutritional deficiency of calcium is manifested at a higher level of organization: 1) depletion of the calcium nutrient reserve; 2) inadequate complexation of digestive byproducts; and 3) collateral effects of hormones produced primarily to compensate for low calcium intake. The first mechanism contributes to the osteoporosis problem, the second to kidney stones and colon cancer, and the third to hypertension, preeclampsia, obesity, and insulin resistance, among others. Adequate calcium intakes (1000-1500 mg/d) in adults have been shown in controlled trials to lower the risk of osteoporotic fractures, kidney stones, obesity, and hypertension. The best source of calcium is dairy foods, largely because the disorders concerned depend upon multiple nutrients, not just calcium, and dairy provides a broad array of essential nutrients in addition to calcium, and at low cost.},

abstract = {Calcium can activate mitochondrial metabolism, and the possibility that mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake and extrusion modulate free cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] (Cac) now has renewed interest. We use whole-cell and perforated patch clamp methods together with rapid local perfusion to introduce probes and inhibitors to rat chromaffin cells, to evoke Ca$^{2+}$ entry, and to monitor Ca$^{2+}$-activated currents that report near-surface [Ca$^{2+}$]. We show that rapid recovery from elevations of Cac requires both the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter and the mitochondrial energization that drives Ca$^{2+}$ uptake through it. Applying imaging and single-cell photometric methods, we find that the probe rhod-2 selectively localizes to mitochondria and uses its responses to quantify mitochondrial free [Ca$^{2+}$] (Cam). The indicated resting Cam of 100-200 nM is similar to the resting Cac reported by the probes indo-1 and Calcium Green, or its dextran conjugate in the cytoplasm. Simultaneous monitoring of Cam and Cac at high temporal resolution shows that, although Cam increases less than Cac, mitochondrial sequestration of Ca$^{2+}$ is fast and has high capacity. We find that mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake limits the rise and underlies the rapid decay of Cac excursions produced by Ca$^{2+}$ entry or by mobilization of reticular stores. We also find that subsequent export of Ca$^{2+}$ from mitochondria, seen as declining Cam, prolongs complete Cac recovery and that suppressing export of Ca$^{2+}$, by inhibition of the mitochondrial Na$^+$/ Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger, reversibly hastens final recovery of Cac. We conclude that mitochondria are active participants in cellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling, whose unique role is determined by their ability to rapidly accumulate and then release large quantities of Ca$^{2+}$.},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ entry through transmitter-gated cation channels, including ATP-gated P2X channels, contributes to an array of physiological processes in excitable and non-excitable cells, but the absolute amount of Ca$^{2+}$ flowing through P2X channels is unknown. Here we address the issue of precisely how much Ca$^{2+}$ flows through P2X channels and report the finding that the ATP-gated P2X channel family has remarkably high Ca$^{2+}$ flux compared with other channels gated by the transmitters ACh, serotonin, protons, and glutamate. Several homomeric and heteromeric P2X channels display fractional Ca$^{2+}$ currents equivalent to NMDA channels, which hitherto have been thought of as the largest source of transmitter-activated Ca$^{2+}$ flux. We further suggest that NMDA and P2X channels may use different mechanisms to promote Ca$^{2+}$ flux across membranes. We find that mutating three critical polar amino acids decreases the Ca$^{2+}$ flux of P2X2 receptors, suggesting that these residues cluster to form a novel type of Ca$^{2+}$ selectivity region within the pore. Overall, our data identify P2X channels as a large source of transmitter-activated Ca$^{2+}$ influx at resting membrane potentials and support the hypothesis that polar amino acids contribute to Ca$^{2+}$ selection in an ATP-gated ion channel.},

abstract = {The Ca$^{2+}$ binding properties of C2 domains are essential for the function of their host proteins. We present here the first crystal structures showing an unexpected Ca$^{2+}$ binding mode of the C2B domain of rabphilin-3A in atomic detail. Acidic residues from the linker region between the C2A and C2B domains of rabphilin-3A interact with the Ca$^{2+}$-binding region of the C2B domain. Because of these interactions, the coordination sphere of the two bound Ca$^{2+}$ ions is almost complete. Mutation of these acidic residues to alanine resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the intrinsic Ca$^{2+}$ binding affinity of the C2B domain. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that this interaction occurred only in the Ca$^{2+}$-bound state of the C2B domain. In addition, this Ca$^{2+}$ binding mode was maintained in the C2 domain tandem fragment. In NMR-based liposome binding assays, the linker was not released upon phospholipid binding. Therefore, this unprecedented Ca$^{2+}$ binding mode not only shows how a C2 domain increases its intrinsic Ca$^{2+}$ affinity, but also provides the structural base for an atypical protein-Ca$^{2+}$-phospholipid binding mode of rabphilin-3A.},

abstract = {We have determined and refined the crystal structure of a recombinant calmodulin at 1.7 A resolution. The structure was determined by molecular replacement, using the 2.2 A published native bovine brain structure as the starting model. The final crystallographic R-factor, using 14,469 reflections in the 10.0 to 1.7 A range with structure factors exceeding 0.5 sigma, is 0.216. Bond lengths and bond angle distances have root-mean-square deviations from ideal values of 0.009 A and 0.032 A, respectively. The final model consists of 1279 non-hydrogen atoms, including four calcium ions, 1130 protein atoms, including three Asp118 side-chain atoms in double conformation, 139 water molecules and one ethanol molecule. The electron densities for residues 1 to 4 and 148 of calmodulin are poorly defined, and not included in our model, except for main-chain atoms of residue 4. The calmodulin structure from our crystals is very similar to the earlier 2.2 A structure described by Babu and coworkers with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.36 A. Calmodulin remains a dumb-bell-shaped molecule, with similar lobes and connected by a central alpha-helix. Each lobe contains three alpha-helices and two Ca$^{2+}$ binding EF hand loops, with a short antiparallel beta-sheet between adjacent EF hand loops and one non-EF hand loop. There are some differences in the structure of the central helix. The crystal packing is extensively studied, and facile crystal growth along the z-axis of the triclinic crystals is explained. Herein, we describe hydrogen bonding in the various secondary structure elements and hydration of calmodulin.},

abstract = {Store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ channels activated by the depletion of Ca$^{2+}$ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are a major Ca$^{2+}$ entry pathway in nonexcitable cells and are essential for T cell activation and adaptive immunity. After store depletion, the ER Ca$^{2+}$ sensor STIM1 and the CRAC channel protein Orai1 redistribute to ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions, but the fundamental issue of how STIM1 activates the CRAC channel at these sites is unresolved. Here, we identify a minimal, highly conserved 107-aa CRAC activation domain (CAD) of STIM1 that binds directly to the N and C termini of Orai1 to open the CRAC channel. Purified CAD forms a tetramer that clusters CRAC channels, but analysis of STIM1 mutants reveals that channel clustering is not sufficient for channel activation. These studies establish a molecular mechanism for store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry in which the direct binding of STIM1 to Orai1 drives the accumulation and the activation of CRAC channels at ER-PM junctions.},

abstract = {The S100 family of calcium binding proteins contains approximately 16 members each of which exhibits a unique pattern of tissue/cell type specific expression. Although the distribution of these proteins is not restricted to the nervous system, the implication of several members of this family in nervous system development, function, and disease has sparked new interest in these proteins. We now know that the original two members of this family, S100A1 and S100B, can regulate a diverse group of cellular functions including cell-cell communication, cell growth, cell structure, energy metabolism, contraction and intracellular signal transduction. Although some members of the family may function extracellularly, most appear to function as intracellular calcium-modulated proteins and couple extracellular stimuli to cellular responses via interaction with other cellular proteins called target proteins. Interaction of these proteins with target proteins appear to involve cysteine residues (one in S100A1 and two in S100B), as well as a stretch of 13 amino acids, in the middle of the molecule called the linker region, which connects the two EF-hand calcium binding domains. In addition to the amino acid sequence and secondary structures of these proteins, the structures of the genes encoding these proteins are highly conserved. Studies on the expression of these proteins have demonstrated that a complex mixture of transcriptional and postranscriptional mechanisms regulate S100 expression. Further analysis of the function and expression of these proteins in both nervous and nonnervous tissues will provide important information regarding the role of altered S100 expression in nervous system development, function and disease.},

The molecular mechanisms responsible for execution of the cell death program are relatively well characterized, but the metabolic events taking place during the adaptive phase of ER stress remain largely undefined. Here we discuss emerging evidence regarding the metabolic changes that occur during the onset of ER stress and how ER influences mitochondrial function through mechanisms involving calcium transfer, thereby facilitating cellular adaptation. Finally, we highlight how dysregulation of ER-mitochondrial calcium homeostasis during prolonged ER stress is emerging as a novel mechanism implicated in the onset of metabolic disorders.},

abstract = {Since the discovery that mitochondrial membrane permeabilization represents a critical step in the regulation of intrinsic apoptosis, mitochondria have been viewed as pluripotent organelles, controlling cell death as well as several aspects of cell survival. Mitochondria constitute the most prominent source of ATP and are implicated in multiple anabolic and catabolic circuitries. In addition, mitochondria coordinate cell-wide stress responses, such as autophagy, and control nonapoptotic cell death routines, such as regulated necrosis. Thus, mitochondria seem to regulate a continuum of cellular functions, spanning from physiological metabolism to stress responses and death. The involvement of mitochondria in both vital and lethal processes is crucial for both embryonic and postembryonic development, as well as for the maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis. In line with this notion, primary mitochondrial defects or alterations in the signaling pathways that converge on or emanate from mitochondria underpin a large number of human diseases, including premature aging, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Here, we provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms that enable mitochondria to sustain cell survival, coordinate stress responses, and mediate cell death, linking these pathways--whenever relevant--to cardiovascular health and disease.},

@article{Putney2007,
abstract = {Activation of phospholipase C by G-protein-coupled receptors results in release of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ and activation of Ca$^{2+}$ channels in the plasma membrane. The intracellular release of Ca$^{2+}$ is signaled by the second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Ca$^{2+}$ entry involves signaling from depleted intracellular stores to plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$ channels, a process referred to as capacitative calcium entry or store-operated calcium entry. The electrophysiological current associated with capacitative calcium entry is the calcium-release-activated calcium current, or I(crac). In the 20 years since the inception of the concept of capacitative calcium entry, a variety of activation mechanisms have been proposed, and there has been considerable interest in the possibility of transient receptor potential channels functioning as store-operated channels. However, in the past 2 years, two major players in both the signaling and permeation mechanisms for store-operated channels have been discovered: Stim1 (and possibly Stim2) and the Orai proteins. Activation of store-operated channels involves an endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{2+}$ sensor called Stim1. Stim1 acts by redistributing within a small component of the endoplasmic reticulum, approaching the plasma membrane, but does not appear to translocate into the plasma membrane. Stim1, either directly or indirectly, signals to plasma membrane Orai proteins which constitute pore-forming subunits of store-operated channels.},

abstract = {An endoplasmic reticulum-like membrane fraction, termed the "mitochondria-associated membrane" (MAM), that co-isolates with mitochondria from rat liver has been characterized. One potential function of the MAM is as a membrane bridge between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria that may be involved in transfer of phospholipids between these two organelles (Vance, J. E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7248-7256). A polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase-2, a specific marker protein of the MAM (Cui, Z., Vance, J. E., Chen, M. H., Voelker, D. R., and Vance, D. E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16655-16663), was used in immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy localization studies in rat hepatocytes. Immunoreactive protein was clustered in regions of the cell that did not correspond to the bulk of endoplasmic reticulum. A second potential role for the MAM, as a component of the secretory pathway that supplies lipids for assembly into very low density lipoproteins, has been examined. The MAM contains enzymes of similar, or higher, specific activities to those enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum for the synthesis of phospholipids, triacylglycerols, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters. Specific activities of diacylglycerol acyltransferase, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase, and phosphatidylserine synthase (base exchange enzyme) are enriched 2.2-3.4-fold in the MAM compared with endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, the microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein, which is required for the assembly/secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, was present in the MAM. Nascent apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins were isolated from the lumen of the MAM. These lipoproteins had the same average density and composition as nascent apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins isolated from heavy and light endoplasmic reticulum fractions, from the Golgi, and lipoproteins newly secreted by cultured rat hepatocytes. The MAM is a pre-Golgi compartment of the secretory route, as shown by pulse-chase studies with apolipoprotein B and albumin, as well as the sensitivity of luminal apolipoprotein B to endoglycosidase H.},

abstract = {Proper cell activity requires an efficient exchange of molecules between mitochondria and cytoplasm. Lying in the outer mitochondrial membrane, VDAC assumes a crucial position in the cell, forming the main interface between the mitochondrial and the cellular metabolisms. As such, it has been recognized that VDAC plays a crucial role in regulating the metabolic and energetic functions of mitochondria. Indeed, down-regulation of VDAC1 expression by shRNA leads to a decrease in energy production and cell growth. VDAC has also been recognized as a key protein in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through its involvement in the release of apoptotic proteins located in the inter-membranal space and as the proposed target of pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl2-family and of hexokinase. Questions, however, remain as to if and how VDAC mediates the transfer of apoptotic proteins from the inter-membranal space to the cytosol. The diameter of the VDAC pore is only about 2.5-3 nm, insufficient for the passage of a folded protein like cytochrome c. New work, however, suggests that pore formation involves the assembly of homo-oligomers of VDAC or hetero-oligomers composed of VDAC and pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax. Thus, VDAC appears to represent a convergence point for a variety of cell survival and cell death signals. This review provides insight into the central role of VDAC in mammalian cell life and death, emphasizing VDAC function in the regulation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and, as such, its potential as a rational target for new therapeutics.},

The model is also able to simulate the sudden disappearance phenomenon of the Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations observed in some cell types by taking into account of the biphasic characteristic of the Ca$^{2+}$ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, the model simulation results for the Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations characteristics such as duration, peak [Ca$^{2+}$](cyt), and average interval, etc., lead to prediction of some possible factors responsible for the variations of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in different types of cells.},

We show that all mitochondria have contacts with the ER, but plasma membrane (PM)-mitochondrial contacts are less frequent because of interleaving ER stacks in both RBL-2H3 and H9c2 cells. Single mitochondria display discrete patches of ER contacts and show heterogeneity in the ER-mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transfer. Pericam-tagged linkers revealed IP(3)-induced [Ca$^{2+}$](ER-mt) signals that exceeded 9 microM and endured buffering bulk cytoplasmic [Ca$^{2+}$] increases. Altering linker length to modify the space available for the Ca$^{2+}$ transfer machinery had a biphasic effect on [Ca$^{2+}$](ER-mt) signals. These studies provide direct evidence for the existence of high-Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains between the ER and mitochondria and suggest an optimal gap width for efficient Ca$^{2+}$ transfer.},

abstract = {By transiently or stably overexpressing the mitochondrial fission factor dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp-1), we evaluated the role of mitochondrial division in organelle Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis and apoptotic signaling. Quantitative 3D digital microscopy revealed a split mitochondrial network in Drp-1-overexpressing cells without changes in cell viability. High-speed mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) imaging revealed propagating intramitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ waves in intact cells, which were blocked in the Drp-1-fragmented network, leaving a fraction of individual mitochondria without substantial [Ca$^{2+}$]m elevation. Consequently, in Drp-1-expressing cells the apoptotic efficacy of ceramide, which causes a Ca$^{2+}$-dependent perturbation of mitochondrial structure and function, was drastically reduced. Conversely, the sensitivity to staurosporine-induced apoptosis, previously shown to be directly triggered by Drp-1-dependent recruitment of proapoptotic proteins to mitochondria, was enhanced. These results demonstrate that the regulated process of mitochondrial fusion and fission controls the spatiotemporal properties of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ responses and, thus, physiological and pathological consequences of cellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals.},

@article{Jung2004,
abstract = {We have expressed aequorin in mitochondria of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and characterized the resulting strain with respect to mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport in vivo and in vitro. When intact cells are suspended in water containing 1.4 mM ethanol and 14 mM CaCl(2), the matrix free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration is 200 nM, similar to the values expected in cytoplasm. Addition of ionophore ETH 129 allows an active accumulation of Ca$^{2+}$ and promptly increases the value to 1.2 microM. Elevated Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations are maintained for periods of 6 min or longer under these conditions. Isolated yeast mitochondria oxidizing ethanol also accumulate Ca$^{2+}$ when ETH 129 is present, but the cation is not retained depending on the medium conditions. This finding confirms the presence of a Ca$^{2+}$ release mechanism that requires free fatty acids as previously described [P.C. Bradshaw et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 40502-40509]. When a respiratory substrate is not present, Ca$^{2+}$ enters and leaves yeast mitochondria slowly, at a specific activity near 0.2 nmol/min/mg protein. Transport under these conditions equilibrates the internal and external concentrations of Ca$^{2+}$ and is not affected by ruthenium red, uncouplers, or ionophores that perturb transmembrane gradients of charge and pH. This activity displays sigmoid kinetics and a K(1/2) value for Ca$^{2+}$ that is near to 900 nM, in the absence of ethanol or when it is present. It is furthermore shown that the activity coefficient of Ca$^{2+}$ in yeast mitochondria is a function of the matrix Ca$^{2+}$ content and is substantially larger than that in mammalian mitochondria. Characteristics of the aequorin-expressing strain appear suitable for its use in expression-based methods directed at cloning Ca$^{2+}$ transporters from mammalian mitochondria and for further examining the interrelationships between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ in yeast.},

abstract = {Dot plots were originally introduced in bioinformatics as dot-containing images used to compare biological sequences and identify regions of close similarity between them. In addition to similarity, dot plots were extended to possibly represent interactions between building blocks of biological sequences, where the dots can vary in size or color according to desired features. In this survey, we first review their use in representing an RNA secondary structure, which has mostly been applied for displaying the output secondary structures as a result of running RNA folding prediction algorithms. Such a result may often contain suboptimal solutions in addition to the optimal one, which can be easily incorporated in the dot plot. We then proceed from their passive use of providing RNA secondary structure snapshots to their active use of illustrating RNA secondary structure manipulations in beneficial ways. While comparison between RNA secondary structures can mostly be done efficiently using a string representation, there are notable advantages in using dot plots for analyzing the suboptimal solutions that convey important information about the structure of the RNA molecule. In addition, structure-based alignment of dot plots has been advanced considerably and the filtering of dot plots that considers chemical and enzymatic data from structure determination experiments has been suggested. We discuss these procedures and how they can be enhanced in the future by using an image representation to analyze RNA secondary structures and examine their manipulations.},

One family member, MCL-1, is unique because its expression is tightly regulated and it is essential for promoting the survival of myriad cellular lineages. Additionally, MCL-1 promotes the maintenance of normal mitochondrial morphology and energy production. Dissection of these functions revealed recently that they depend on separate mitochondrial sublocalizations. MCL-1's antiapoptotic activity is restricted to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), whereas its function in mitochondrial physiology requires localization to the matrix. These findings provide an attractive model for how MCL-1's diverse functions may contribute to normal cell homeostasis and function. MCL-1 is highly amplified in human cancer, suggesting that these functions may contribute to malignant cell growth and evasion of apoptosis.},

STIM1 is not secreted from cells and does not appear to undergo proteolytic processing. We show evidence of post-translational modification of STIM1, namely phosphorylation and N-linked glycosylation. Phosphorylation of STIM1 in vivo occurs predominantly on serine residues.

In response to a whole-cell, homogeneous application of inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)), the model predicts that 1), at lower concentrations of IP(3), the intracellular waves in pancreatic cells begin in the apical region and are actively propagated across the basal region by Ca$^{2+}$ release through ryanodine receptors; 2), at higher [IP(3)], the waves in pancreatic and parotid cells are not true waves but rather apparent waves, formed as the result of sequential activation of inositol trisphosphate receptors in the apical and basal regions; 3), the differences in wave propagation in pancreatic and parotid cells can be explained in part by differences in inositol trisphosphate receptor density; 4), in pancreatic cells, increased Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by the mitochondria is capable of restricting Ca$^{2+}$ responses to the apical region, but that this happens only for a relatively narrow range of [IP(3)]; and 5), at higher [IP(3)], the apical and basal regions of the cell act as coupled Ca$^{2+}$ oscillators, with the basal region partially entrained to the apical region.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: A mass spectrum produced via tandem mass spectrometry can be tentatively matched to a peptide sequence via database search. Here, we address the problem of assigning a posterior error probability (PEP) to a given peptide-spectrum match (PSM). This problem is considerably more dif.cult than the related problem of estimating the error rate associated with a large collection of PSMs. Existing methods for estimating PEPs rely on a parametric or semiparametric model of the underlying score distribution.

RESULTS: We demonstrate how to apply non-parametric logistic regression to this problem. The method makes no explicit assumptions about the form of the underlying score distribution; instead, the method relies upon decoy PSMs, produced by searching the spectra against a decoy sequence database, to provide a model of the null score distribution. We show that our non-parametric logistic regression method produces accurate PEP estimates for six different commonly used PSM score functions. In particular, the estimates produced by our method are comparable in accuracy to those of PeptideProphet, which uses a parametric or semiparametric model designed speci.cally to work with SEQUEST. The advantage of the non-parametric approach is applicability and robustness to new score functions and new types of data.

abstract = {The membrane permeability transition (MPT) of mitochondria plays an important role in the mechanism of apoptotic cell death in various cells. Classic type MPT is induced by Ca$^{2+}$ in the presence of inorganic phosphate and respiratory substrate, and is characterized by various events including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane depolarization, swelling, release of Ca$^{2+}$ and high sensitivity to cyclosporine A. However, the sequence of these events and the effect of antioxidants on their events remain obscure. Flow cytometry is a convenient method to investigate the order of events among various functions occurring in MPT using a limited amount of mitochondria (200 microl of 0.02 mg protein/ml) without contamination by other organelles. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that Ca$^{2+}$ sequentially induced ROS generation, depolarization, swelling and Ca$^{2+}$ release in mitochondria by a cyclosporine A-inhibitable mechanism. These results were supported by the finding that Ca$^{2+}$-induced MPT was inhibited by antioxidants, such as glutathione and N-acetylcysteine. It was also revealed that various inhibitors of Ca$^{2+}$-induced phospholipase A(2) suppressed all of the events associated with Ca$^{2+}$-induced MPT. These results suggested that ROS generation and phospholipase A(2) activation by Ca$^{2+}$ underlie the mechanism of the initiation of MPT.},

@article{Gibson1996,
abstract = {The prototypic mammalian regulator of cell death is bcl-2, the oncogene implicated in the development of human follicular lymphoma. Several homologues of bcl-2 are now known. Using a PCR-based strategy we cloned a novel member of this gene family, denoted bcl-w. The gene, which is highly conserved between mouse and human, resides near the T-cell antigen receptor alpha gene within the central portion of mouse chromosome 14 and on human chromosome 14 at band q11. Enforced expression of bcl-w rendered lymphoid and myeloid cells refractory to several (but not all) cytotoxic conditions. Thus, like Bcl-2 and Bcl-x, the Bcl-w protein promotes cell survival, in contrast to other close homologues, Bax and Bak, which facilitate cell death. Comparison of the expected amino acid sequence of Bcl-w with that of these relatives helps to delineate residues likely to convey survival or anti-survival function. While expression of bcl-w was uncommon in B or T lymphoid cell lines, the mRNA was observed in almost all murine myeloid cell lines analysed and in a wide range of tissues. These findings suggest that bcl-w participates in the control of apoptosis in multiple cell types. Its functional similarity to bcl-2 also makes it an attractive candidate proto-oncogene.},

abstract = {When cellular organelles communicate bad things can happen. Recent findings uncovered that the junction between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria holds a crucial role for cell death regulation. Not only does this locale connect the two best-known organelles in apoptosis, numerous regulators of cell death are concentrated at this spot, providing a terrain for intense signal transfers. Ca$^{2+}$ is the most prominent signalling factor that is released from the ER and, at high concentration, mediates the transfer of an apoptosis signal to mitochondria as the executioner organelle for cell death. An elaborate array of checks and balances is fine-tuning this process including Bcl-2 family members. Moreover, MAMs, "mitochondria-associated membranes", are distinct membrane sections at the ER that are in close contact with mitochondria and have been found to exchange lipids and lipid-derived molecules such as ceramide for apoptosis induction. Recent work has also described a reverse transfer of apoptosis signals, from mitochondria to the ER, via cytochrome c release and prolonged IP3R opening or through the mitochondrial fission factor Fis1 and Bap31 at the ER, which form the ARCosome, a novel caspase-activation complex.},

abstract = {In Xenopus oocytes, as well as other cells, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release is an excitable process that generates propagating Ca$^{2+}$ waves that annihilate upon collision. The fundamental property responsible for excitability appears to be the Ca$^{2+}$ dependency of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. Here we report that Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca$^{2+}$ wave activity is strengthened by oxidizable substrates that energize mitochondria, increasing Ca$^{2+}$ wave amplitude, velocity and interwave period. The effects of pyruvate/malate are blocked by ruthenium red at the Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter, by rotenone at complex I, and by antimycin A at complex III, and are subsequently rescued at complex IV by ascorbate tetramethylphenylenediamine (TMPD). Our data reveal that potential-driven mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake is a major factor in the regulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release and clearly demonstrate a physiological role of mitochondria in intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signalling.},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ transport through mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter is the primary Ca$^{2+}$ uptake mechanism in respiring mitochondria. Thus, the uniporter plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$. Despite the importance of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ to metabolic regulation and mitochondrial function, and to cell physiology and pathophysiology, the structure and composition of the uniporter functional unit and kinetic mechanisms associated with Ca$^{2+}$ transport into mitochondria are still not well understood. In this study, based on available experimental data on the kinetics of Ca$^{2+}$ transport via the uniporter, a mechanistic kinetic model of the uniporter is introduced. The model is thermodynamically balanced and satisfactorily describes a large number of independent data sets in the literature on initial or pseudo-steady-state influx rates of Ca$^{2+}$ via the uniporter measured under a wide range of experimental conditions. The model is derived assuming a multi-state catalytic binding and Eyring's free-energy barrier theory-based transformation mechanisms associated with the carrier-mediated facilitated transport and electrodiffusion. The model is a great improvement over the previous theoretical models of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter in the literature in that it is thermodynamically balanced and matches a large number of independently published data sets on mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. This theoretical model will be critical in developing mechanistic, integrated models of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling and bioenergetics which can be helpful in understanding the mechanisms by which Ca$^{2+}$ plays a role in mediating signaling pathways and modulating mitochondrial energy metabolism.},

abstract = {Astrocytes in the brain form an intimately associated network with neurons. They respond to neuronal activity and synaptically released glutamate by raising intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]i), which could represent the start of back-signalling to neurons. Here we show that coactivation of the AMPA/kainate and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) on astrocytes stimulates these cells to release glutamate through a Ca$^{2+}$-dependent process mediated by prostaglandins. Pharmacological inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis prevents glutamate release, whereas application of prostaglandins (in particular PGE2) mimics and occludes the releasing action of GluR agonists. PGE2 promotes Ca$^{2+}$-dependent glutamate release from cultured astrocytes and also from acute brain slices under conditions that suppress neuronal exocytotic release. When applied to the CA1 hippocampal region, PGE2 induces increases in [Ca$^{2+}$]i both in astrocytes and in neurons. The [Ca$^{2+}$]i increase in neurons is mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes, because it is abolished by GluR antagonists. Our results reveal a new pathway of regulated transmitter release from astrocytes and outline the existence of an integrated glutamatergic cross-talk between neurons and astrocytes in situ that may play critical roles in synaptic plasticity and in neurotoxicity.},

abstract = {Calpains are a family of complex multi-domain intracellular enzymes that share a calcium-dependent cysteine protease core. These are not degradative enzymes, but instead carry out limited cleavage of target proteins in response to calcium signalling. Selective cutting of cytoskeletal proteins to facilitate cell migration is one such function. The two most abundant and extensively studied members of this family in mammals, calpains 1 and 2, are heterodimers of an isoform-specific 80 kDa large subunit and a common 28 kDa small subunit. Structures of calpain-2, both Ca$^{2+}$-free and bound to calpastatin in the activated Ca$^{2+}$-bound state, have provided a wealth of information about the enzyme's structure-function relationships and activation. The main association between the subunits is the pairing of their C-terminal penta-EF-hand domains through extensive intimate hydrophobic contacts. A lesser contact is made between the N-terminal anchor helix of the large subunit and the penta-EF-hand domain of the small subunit. Up to ten Ca$^{2+}$ ions are co-operatively bound during activation. The anchor helix is released and individual domains change their positions relative to each other to properly align the active site. Because calpains 1 and 2 require \~{}30 and \~{}350 $\mu$M Ca$^{2+}$ ions for half-maximal activation respectively, it has long been argued that autoproteolysis, subunit dissociation, post-translational modifications or auxiliary proteins are needed to activate the enzymes in the cell, where Ca$^{2+}$ levels are in the nanomolar range. In the absence of robust support for these mechanisms, it is possible that under normal conditions calpains are transiently activated by high Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations in the microenvironment of a Ca$^{2+}$ influx, and then return to an inactive state ready for reactivation.},

We obtain a single transport equation for Ca$^{2+}$ that contains the effects caused by both stationary and mobile buffers. For stationary buffers alone, we obtain an expression for the effective diffusion constant of Ca$^{2+}$ that depends on local Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations. Mobile buffers, such as fura-2, BAPTA, or small endogenous proteins, give rise to a transport equation that is no longer strictly diffusive. Calculations are presented to show that these effects can modify greatly the manner and rate at which Ca$^{2+}$ diffuses in cells, and we compare these results with recent measurements by Allbritton et al. (1992). As a prelude to work on Ca$^{2+}$ waves, we use a simplified version of our model of the activation and inhibition of the IP3 receptor Ca$^{2+}$ channel in the ER membrane to illustrate the way in which Ca$^{2+}$ buffering can affect both the amplitude and existence of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations.},

abstract = {Calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) is essential in regulating a plethora of cellular functions that includes cell proliferation and differentiation, axonal guidance and cell migration, neuro/enzyme secretion and exocytosis, development/maintenance of neural circuits, cell death and many more. Since Ca$^{2+}$ regulates so many fundamental processes, it could be anticipated that numerous Ca$^{2+}$ channels and transporters will assist in regulating Ca$^{2+}$ entry across the plasma membrane. Towards this several Ca$^{2+}$ channels such as voltage-gated channels, store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry (SOCE) channels, NMDA, AMPA and other ligand gated channels have been identified. In recent years research focus has been targeted towards identification of the precise function of these essential channels. Furthermore, characterization of these individual Ca$^{2+}$ channels has also gained much attention, since specific Ca$^{2+}$ channels have been shown to influence a particular cellular response. Moreover, perturbations in these Ca$^{2+}$ channels have also been implicated in a spectrum of pathological conditions. Hence, understanding the precise involvement of these Ca$^{2+}$ channels in disease conditions would presumably unveil avenues for plausible therapeutic interventions. We thus review the role of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in select -disease conditions and also provide experimental evidence as how they can be characterized in a given cell.},

@article{Shuttleworth1997,
abstract = {The secretion of ions and fluid plays a critical role in a variety of physiological activities that are vital to homeostatic mechanisms in animals. Control of such secretory activity is achieved by a range of neurotransmitters and hormones many of which act intracellularly by generating the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and increasing cytosolic free calcium ion concentrations ([Ca$^{2+}$]i). These increases are achieved by a combination of the InsP3-induced release of Ca$^{2+}$ from specific intracellular stores and the activation of Ca$^{2+}$ entry from the extracellular environment. The [Ca$^{2+}$]i signal represents a balance between the adequate activation of components of the secretory mechanism and the avoidance of [Ca$^{2+}$]i levels that are toxic to the cell. Resting [Ca$^{2+}$]i is maintained low by the action of Ca$^{2+}$ pumps on the intracellular stores and plasma membrane, with the result that gradients for Ca$^{2+}$ movement into the cytosol from either of these two sources are very large and there is considerable potential for achieving rapid increases in [Ca$^{2+}$]i. Consequently, for successful Ca$^{2+}$ signalling, it is imperative that these two mechanisms of raising [Ca$^{2+}$]i (i.e. Ca$^{2+}$ release and Ca$^{2+}$ entry) are closely integrated. Current models emphasize the activation of Ca$^{2+}$ entry as a downstream result of the emptying of the intracellular stores ("capacitative' model). Whilst this may be true for situations of maximal stimulation, recent experiments on the oscillatory [Ca$^{2+}$]i responses typical of more physiological levels of stimulation indicate a previously unsuspected, independent activation of Ca$^{2+}$ entry involving arachidonic acid. This arachidonic-acid-activated entry plays a key role, along with InsP3, in inducing the repetitive release of Ca$^{2+}$ from the stores to produce the [Ca$^{2+}$]i oscillations. In this way, the two components responsible for the elevation of [Ca$^{2+}$]i are intimately related and their dual effects closely coordinated, resulting in the finely tuned control of agonist-induced changes in [Ca$^{2+}$]i.},

abstract = {Endomembranes modify the progression of the cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ wave and contribute to generate Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains, both in the cytosol and inside the own organella. The concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ in the cytosol ([Ca$^{2+}$](C)), the mitochondria ([Ca$^{2+}$](M)) and the nucleus ([Ca$^{2+}$](N)) are similar at rest, but may become very different during cell activation. Mitochondria avidly take up Ca$^{2+}$ from the high [Ca$^{2+}$](C) microdomains generated during cell activation near Ca$^{2+}$ channels of the plasma membrane and/or the endomembranes and prevent propagation of the high Ca$^{2+}$ signal to the bulk cytosol. This shaping of [Ca$^{2+}$](C) signaling is essential for independent regulation of compartmentalized cell functions. On the other hand, a high [Ca$^{2+}$](M) signal is generated selectively in the mitochondria close to the active areas, which tunes up respiration to the increased local needs. The progression of the [Ca$^{2+}$](C) signal to the nucleus may be dampened by mitochondria, the nuclear envelope or higher buffering power inside the nucleoplasm. On the other hand, selective [Ca$^{2+}$](N) signals could be generated by direct release of stored Ca$^{2+}$ into the nucleoplasm. Ca$^{2+}$ release could even be restricted to subnuclear domains. Putative Ca$^{2+}$ stores include the nuclear envelope, their invaginations inside the nucleoplasm (nucleoplasmic reticulum) and nuclear microvesicles. Inositol trisphosphate, cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate have all been reported to produce release of Ca$^{2+}$ into the nucleoplasm, but contribution of these mechanisms under physiological conditions is still uncertain.},

abstract = {Mammalian eggs and embryos rely upon mitochondrial ATP production to survive and proceed through preimplantation development. Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations at fertilization have been shown to cause a reduction of mitochondrial NAD+ and flavoproteins, suggesting they might also cause changes in cytosolic ATP levels. Here, we have monitored intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ and ATP levels in fertilizing mouse eggs by imaging the fluorescence of a Ca$^{2+}$ dye and luminescence of firefly luciferase. At fertilization an initial increase in ATP levels occurs with the first Ca$^{2+}$ transient, with a second increase occurring about 1 h later. The increase in cytosolic ATP was estimated to be from a prefertilization concentration of 1.9 mM to a peak value of 3 mM. ATP levels returned to prefertilization values as the Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations terminated. An increase in ATP also occurred with other stimuli that increase Ca$^{2+}$ and it was blocked when Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations were inhibited by BAPTA injection. Additionally, an ATP increase was not seen when eggs were activated by cycloheximide, which does not cause a Ca$^{2+}$ increase. These data suggest that mammalian fertilization is associated with a sudden but transient increase in cytosolic ATP and that Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations are both necessary and sufficient to cause this increase in ATP levels.},

abstract = {Increases of mitochondrial matrix [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$](m)) evoked by calcium mobilizing agonists play a fundamental role in the physiological control of cellular energy metabolism. Here, we report that apoptotic stimuli induce a switch in mitochondrial calcium signalling at the beginning of the apoptotic process by facilitating Ca$^{2+}$-induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). Thus [Ca$^{2+}$](m) signals evoked by addition of large Ca$^{2+}$ pulses or, unexpectedly, by IP(3)-mediated cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] spikes trigger mitochondrial permeability transition and, in turn, cytochrome c release. IP(3)-induced opening of PTP is dependent on a privileged Ca$^{2+}$ signal transmission from IP(3) receptors to mitochondria. After the decay of Ca$^{2+}$ spikes, resealing of PTP occurs allowing mitochondrial metabolism to recover, whereas activation of caspases is triggered by cytochrome c released to the cytosol. This organization provides an efficient mechanism to establish caspase activation while mitochondrial metabolism is maintained to meet ATP requirements of apoptotic cell death.},

abstract = {Mitochondria are key decoding stations of the apoptotic process. In support of this view, a large body of experimental evidence has unambiguously revealed that, in addition to the well-established function of producing most of the cellular ATP, mitochondria play a fundamental role in triggering apoptotic cell death. Various apoptotic stimuli cause the release of specific mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors into the cytosol. The molecular mechanism of this release is still controversial, but there is no doubt that mitochondrial calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) overload is one of the pro-apoptotic ways to induce the swelling of mitochondria, with perturbation or rupture of the outer membrane, and in turn the release of mitochondrial apoptotic factors into the cytosol. Here, we review as different proteins that participate in mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis and in turn modulate the effectiveness of Ca$^{2+}$-dependent apoptotic stimuli. Strikingly, the final outcome at the cellular level is similar, albeit through completely different molecular mechanisms: a reduced mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ overload upon pro-apoptotic stimuli that dramatically blunts the apoptotic response.},

@article{Rizzuto1994,
abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ is a key regulator not only of multiple cytosolic enzymes, but also of a variety of metabolic pathways occurring within the lumen of intracellular organelles. Until recently, no technique to selectively monitor the Ca$^{2+}$ concentration within defined cellular compartments was available. We have recently proposed the use of molecularly engineered Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive photoproteins to obtain such a result and demonstrated the application of this methodology to the study of mitochondrial and nuclear Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics. We here describe in more detail the use of chimeric recombinant aequorin targeted to the mitochondria. The technique can be applied with equivalent results to different cell models, transiently or permanently transfected. In all the cell types we analyzed, mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) increases rapidly and transiently upon stimulation with agonists coupled to InsP3 generation. We confirm that the high speed of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation with this type of stimuli depends on the generation of local gradients of Ca$^{2+}$ in the cytosol, close to the channels sensitive to InsP3. In fact, only activation of these channels, but not the simple release from internal stores, as that elicited by blocking the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ ATPases, results in a fast mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation. We also provide evidence in favor of a microheterogeneity among mitochondria of the same cells, about 30\% of them apparently sensing the microdomains of high cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]c). The changes in [Ca$^{2+}$]m appear sufficiently large to induce a rapid activation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, which can be followed by monitoring the level of NAD(P)H fluorescence. A general scheme can thus be envisaged by which the triggering of a plasma membrane receptor coupled to InsP3 generation raises the Ca$^{2+}$ concentration both in the cytoplasm (thereby triggering energy-consuming processes, such as cell proliferation, motility, secretion, etc.) and in the mitochondria, where it activates the metabolic activity according to the increased cell needs.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial apoptosis plays a critical role in tumor maintenance and dictates the response to therapy in vivo; however, the regulators of this process are still largely elusive. Here, we show that the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) directly associates with cyclophilin D (CypD), a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This interaction occurs in a multichaperone complex comprising Hsp60, Hsp90, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein-1, selectively assembled in tumor but not in normal mitochondria. Genetic targeting of Hsp60 by siRNA triggers CypD-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition, caspase-dependent apoptosis, and suppression of intracranial glioblastoma growth in vivo. Therefore, Hsp60 is a novel regulator of mitochondrial permeability transition, contributing to a cytoprotective chaperone network that antagonizes CypD-dependent cell death in tumors.},

Ca$^{2+}$-induced PTP opening began with and depended on mCICR. mCICR was a prerequisite for H2O2 and As2O3-induced PTP opening. The results indicated that the PTP opening was determined by Ca$^{2+}$ stimulation intensity but not mode. PTP could switch from low- to high-conductance conformation and the PTP open by high-conductance began with low-conductance state. mCICR is necessary for Ca$^{2+}$-dependent PTP opening.

The structure is strikingly different from that of the ryanodine receptor at similar resolution despite molecular similarities between these two calcium release channels. The 24 A resolution structure of the IP(3)R takes the shape of an uneven dumbbell, and is approximately 170 A tall. Its larger end is bulky, with four arms protruding laterally by approximately 50 A and, in comparison with the receptor topology, probably corresponds to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. The lateral dimension at the height of the protruding arms is approximately 155 A. The smaller end, whose lateral dimension is approximately 100 A, has structural features indicative of the membrane-spanning domain. A central opening in this domain, which is occluded on the cytoplasmic half, outlines a pathway for calcium flow in the open state of the channel.},

Apoptosis and necrosis are the most widely recognized forms of hepatocyte cell death. The hepatocyte displays many unique features regarding cell death by apoptosis. It is quite susceptible to death receptor-mediated injury, and its death receptor signaling pathways involve the mitochondrial pathway for efficient cell killing. Also, death receptors can trigger lysosomal disruption in hepatocytes which further promote cell and tissue injury. Interestingly, hepatocytes are protected from cell death by only two anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, which have nonredundant functions. Endoplasmic reticulum stress or the unfolded protein response contributes to hepatocyte cell death during alterations of lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Finally, the current information implicating RIP kinases in necrosis provides an approach to more fully address this mode of cell death in hepatocyte injury. All of these processes contributing to hepatocyte injury are discussed in the context of potential therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {GRP78 is a major protein regulated by the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and up-regulation has been shown to be important in protecting cells from challenge with cytotoxic agents. GRP78 has ATPase activity, acts as a chaperone, and interacts specifically with other proteins, such as caspases, as part of a mechanism regulating apoptosis. GRP78 is also reported to have a possible role as a Ca$^{2+}$ storage protein. In order to understand the potential biological effects of Ca$^{2+}$ and ATP/ADP binding on the biology of GRP78, we have determined its ligand binding properties. We show here for the first time that GRP78 can bind Ca$^{2+}$, ATP, and ADP, each with a 1:1 stoichiometry, and that the binding of cation and nucleotide is cooperative. These observations do not support the hypothesis that GRP78 is a dynamic Ca$^{2+}$ storage protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that whereas Mg2+ enhances GRP78 binding to ADP and ATP to the same extent, Ca$^{2+}$ shows a differential enhancement. In the presence of Ca$^{2+}$, the KD for ATP is lowered approximately 11-fold, and the KD for ADP is lowered around 930-fold. The KD for Ca$^{2+}$ is lowered approximately 40-fold in the presence of ATP and around 880-fold with ADP. These findings may explain the biological requirement for a nucleotide exchange factor to remove ADP from GRP78. Taken together, our data suggest that the Ca$^{2+}$-binding property of GRP78 may be part of a signal transduction pathway that modulates complex interactions between GRP78, ATP/ADP, secretory proteins, and caspases, and this ultimately has important consequences for cell viability.},

abstract = {The ryanodine-sensitive calcium channels are pivotal to signal transduction and cell function in many cell types, including cardiac myocytes. In this paper a kinetic model is proposed for these channels. In the model there are two Ca regulatory sites on the channel protein, one positive and the other negative. Cytoplasmic Ca binds to these regulatory sites independently It is assumed that the binding of Ca to the positive site is a much faster process than binding to the negative site. At steady state, the channel opening as a function of the Ca concentration is a bell-shaped curve. The model predicts the adaptation of channels to constant Ca stimulus. When this model is applied to cardiac myocytes, it predicts excitability with respect to Ca perturbations, smoothly graded responses, and Ca oscillations in certain pathological circumstances. In a spatially distributed system, traveling Ca waves in individual myocytes exist under certain conditions. This model can also be applied to other systems where the ryanodine-sensitive channels have been identified.},

@article{Dupont2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Oscillations of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ are well-known to rely on the regulatory properties of the InsP3R (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor). Three isoforms of this channel have been identified. They differ in their regulatory properties by Ca$^{2+}$ and InsP3. Experiments in different cell types clearly indicate that the relative amounts of each isoform affect the time course of Ca$^{2+}$ changes after agonist stimulation. In the present study, we investigate whether different steady-state curves for the open probability of the InsP3Rs as a function of Ca$^{2+}$ imply different dynamical behaviours when these receptors are present in a cellular environment. We therefore describe by a specific phenomenological model the three main types of curves that have been reported: (i) the classical bell-shaped curve, (ii) the bell-shaped curve that is shifted towards higher Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations when InsP3 is increased, and (iii) a monotonous increasing function of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$.

RESULTS: We show that, although these types of curves can be ascribed to slight differences in the channel regulation by Ca$^{2+}$ and InsP3, they can indicate important variations as to the receptor role in cellular Ca$^{2+}$ control. Thus the receptor associated with the classical bell-shaped curve appears to be the most robust Ca$^{2+}$ oscillator. If the steady-state curve is supposed to be a monotonous increasing function of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$, the modelled receptor cannot sustain Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in the absence of Ca$^{2+}$ exchanges with the extracellular medium. When the bell-shaped curve is shifted towards higher Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations with increasing InsP3 levels, the model predicts that the receptor is less robust to changes in density; this receptor, however, provides a finer control of the steady-state level of Ca$^{2+}$ when varying the InsP3 concentration.

CONCLUSIONS: Our model allows us to propose an explanation for the experimental observations about the effect of selectively expressing or down-regulating InsP3R isoforms, as well as to make theoretical predictions.},

Additionally, those professionals who are in need of an update on smooth muscle physiology may find this review to be useful. Smooth muscle lacks the striations characteristic of cardiac and skeletal muscle. Layers of smooth muscle cells line the walls of various organs and tubes in the body, and the contractile function of smooth muscle is not under voluntary control. Contractile activity in smooth muscle is initiated by a Ca$^{2+}$-calmodulin interaction to stimulate phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin. Ca$^{2+}$ sensitization of the contractile proteins is signaled by the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway to inhibit the dephosphorylation of the light chain by myosin phosphatase, thereby maintaining force generation. Removal of Ca$^{2+}$ from the cytosol and stimulation of myosin phosphatase initiate the process of smooth muscle relaxation.},

abstract = {Intracellular calcium release is a prime example for the role of stochastic effects in cellular systems. Recent models consist of deterministic reaction-diffusion equations coupled to stochastic transitions of calcium channels. The resulting dynamics is of multiple time and spatial scales, which complicates far-reaching computer simulations. In this article, we introduce a novel hybrid scheme that is especially tailored to accurately trace events with essential stochastic variations, while deterministic concentration variables are efficiently and accurately traced at the same time. We use finite elements to efficiently resolve the extreme spatial gradients of concentration variables close to a channel. We describe the algorithmic approach and we demonstrate its efficiency compared to conventional methods. Our single-channel model matches experimental data and results in intriguing dynamics if calcium is used as charge carrier. Random openings of the channel accumulate in bursts of calcium blips that may be central for the understanding of cellular calcium dynamics.},

abstract = {In a variety of cells, hormonal or neurotransmitter signals elicit a train of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ spikes. The analysis of a minimal model based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release from intracellular stores shows how sustained oscillations of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ may develop as a result of a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) triggered by external stimulation. This rise elicits the release of a certain amount of Ca$^{2+}$ from an InsP3-sensitive intracellular store. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ in turn triggers the release of Ca$^{2+}$ from a second store insensitive to InsP3. In contrast to the model proposed by Meyer and Stryer [Meyer, T. \& Stryer, L. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5051-5055], the present model, which contains only two variables, predicts the occurrence of periodic Ca$^{2+}$ spikes in the absence of InsP3 oscillations. Such results indicate that repetitive Ca$^{2+}$ spikes evoked by external stimuli do not necessarily require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The model is closely related to that proposed by Kuba and Takeshita [Kuba, K. \& Takeshita, S. (1981) J. Theor. Biol. 93, 1009-1031] for Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in sympathetic neurones, based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release. We extend their results by showing the minimal conditions in which the latter process gives rise to periodic behavior and take into account the role of the rise in InsP3 caused by external stimulation. The analysis further shows how signal-induced Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations might be effectively encoded in terms of their frequency through the phosphorylation of a cellular substrate by a protein kinase activated by cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) often identify disease-associated mutations in intergenic and non-coding regions of the genome. Given the high percentage of the human genome that is transcribed, we postulate that for some observed associations the disease phenotype is caused by a structural rearrangement in a regulatory region of the RNA transcript. To identify such mutations, we have performed a genome-wide analysis of all known disease-associated Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) that map to the untranslated regions (UTRs) of a gene. Rather than using minimum free energy approaches (e.g. mFold), we use a partition function calculation that takes into consideration the ensemble of possible RNA conformations for a given sequence. We identified in the human genome disease-associated SNPs that significantly alter the global conformation of the UTR to which they map. For six disease-states (Hyperferritinemia Cataract Syndrome, beta-Thalassemia, Cartilage-Hair Hypoplasia, Retinoblastoma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and Hypertension), we identified multiple SNPs in UTRs that alter the mRNA structural ensemble of the associated genes. Using a Boltzmann sampling procedure for sub-optimal RNA structures, we are able to characterize and visualize the nature of the conformational changes induced by the disease-associated mutations in the structural ensemble. We observe in several cases (specifically the 5' UTRs of FTL and RB1) SNP-induced conformational changes analogous to those observed in bacterial regulatory Riboswitches when specific ligands bind. We propose that the UTR and SNP combinations we identify constitute a "RiboSNitch," that is a regulatory RNA in which a specific SNP has a structural consequence that results in a disease phenotype. Our SNPfold algorithm can help identify RiboSNitches by leveraging GWAS data and an analysis of the mRNA structural ensemble.},

abstract = {Verapamil is a potent phenylalkylamine antihypertensive believed to exert its therapeutic effect primarily by blocking high-voltage-activated L-type calcium channels. It was the first clinically used calcium channel blocker and remains in clinical use, although it has been eclipsed by other calcium channel blockers because of its short half-life and interactions with other channels. In addition to blocking L-type channels, it has been reported to block T-type (low-voltage activated) calcium channels. This type of cross-reactivity is likely to be beneficial in the effective control of blood pressure. Although the interactions of T channels with a number of drugs have been described, the mechanisms by which these agents modulate channel activity are largely unknown. Most calcium channel blockers exhibit state-dependence (i.e., preferential binding to certain channel conformations), but little is known about state-dependent verapamil block of T channels. We stably expressed human Ca(v)3.1 T-type channels in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and studied the state-dependence of the drug with macroscopic and gating currents. Verapamil blocked currents at micromolar concentrations at polarized potentials similar to those reported for L-type channels, although unlike for L-type currents, it did not affect current time course. The drug exhibited use-dependence and significantly slowed the apparent recovery from inactivation. Current inhibition was dependent on potential. This dependence was restricted to negative potentials, although all data were consistent with verapamil binding in the pore. Gating currents were unaffected by verapamil. We propose that verapamil achieves its inhibitory effect via occlusion of the channel pore associated with an open/inactivated conformation of the channel.},

@article{Bazil2011,
abstract = {Mitochondria possess a remarkable ability to rapidly accumulate and sequester Ca²⁺. One of the mechanisms responsible for this ability is believed to be the rapid mode (RaM) of Ca²⁺ uptake. Despite the existence of many models of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ dynamics, very few consider RaM as a potential mechanism that regulates mitochondrial Ca²⁺ dynamics. To fill this gap, a novel mathematical model of the RaM mechanism is developed herein. The model is able to simulate the available experimental data of rapid Ca²⁺ uptake in isolated mitochondria from both chicken heart and rat liver tissues with good fidelity. The mechanism is based on Ca²⁺ binding to an external trigger site(s) and initiating a brief transient of high Ca²⁺ conductivity. It then quickly switches to an inhibited, zero-conductive state until the external Ca²⁺ level is dropped below a critical value (∼100-150 nM). RaM's Ca²⁺- and time-dependent properties make it a unique Ca²⁺ transporter that may be an important means by which mitochondria take up Ca²⁺ in situ and help enable mitochondria to decode cytosolic Ca²⁺ signals. Integrating the developed RaM model into existing models of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ dynamics will help elucidate the physiological role that this unique mechanism plays in mitochondrial Ca²⁺-homeostasis and bioenergetics.},

abstract = {One mechanism by which communication between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria is achieved is by close juxtaposition between these organelles via mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM). The MAM consist of a region of the ER that is enriched in several lipid biosynthetic enzyme activities and becomes reversibly tethered to mitochondria. Specific proteins are localized, sometimes transiently, in the MAM. Several of these proteins have been implicated in tethering the MAM to mitochondria. In mammalian cells, formation of these contact sites between MAM and mitochondria appears to be required for key cellular events including the transport of calcium from the ER to mitochondria, the import of phosphatidylserine into mitochondria from the ER for decarboxylation to phosphatidylethanolamine, the formation of autophagosomes, regulation of the morphology, dynamics and functions of mitochondria, and cell survival. This review focuses on the functions proposed for MAM in mediating these events in mammalian cells. In light of the apparent involvement of MAM in multiple fundamental cellular processes, recent studies indicate that impaired contact between MAM and mitochondria might underlie the pathology of several human neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, MAM has been implicated in modulating glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, as well as in some viral infections.},

abstract = {The International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) database, IUPHAR-DB (http://www.iuphar-db.org) is an open access, online database providing detailed, expert-driven annotation of the primary literature on human and rodent receptors and other drug targets, together with the substances that act on them. The present release includes information on the products of 646 genes from four major protein classes (G protein-coupled receptors, nuclear hormone receptors, voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels) and ∼3180 bioactive molecules (endogenous ligands, licensed drugs and key pharmacological tools) that interact with them. We have described previously the classification and curation of data for small molecule ligands in the database; in this update we have annotated 366 endogenous peptide ligands with their amino acid sequences, post-translational modifications, links to precursor genes, species differences and relationships with other molecules in the database (e.g. those derived from the same precursor). We have also matched targets with their endogenous ligands (peptides and small molecules), with particular attention paid to identifying bioactive peptide ligands generated by post-translational modification of precursor proteins. Other improvements to the database include enhanced information on the clinical relevance of targets and ligands in the database, more extensive links to other databases and a pilot project for the curation of enzymes as drug targets.},

abstract = {We examined the ionic mechanisms mediating depolarization-induced spike activity in pancreatic beta-cells. We formulated a Hodgkin-Huxley-type ionic model for the action potential (AP) in these cells based on voltage- and current-clamp results together with measurements of Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics in wild-type and Kv2.1 null mouse islets. The model contains an L-type Ca$^{2+}$ current, a "rapid" delayed-rectifier K(+) current, a small slowly-activated K(+) current, a Ca$^{2+}$-activated K(+) current, an ATP-sensitive K(+) current, a plasma membrane calcium-pump current and a Na(+) background current. This model, coupled with an equation describing intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis, replicates beta-cell AP and Ca$^{2+}$ changes during one glucose-induced spontaneous spike, the effects of blocking K(+) currents with different inhibitors, and specific complex spike in mouse islets lacking Kv2.1 channels. The currents with voltage-independent gating variables can also be responsible for burst behavior. Original features of this model include new equations for L-type Ca$^{2+}$ current, assessment of the role of rapid delayed-rectifier K(+) current, and Ca$^{2+}$-activated K(+) currents, demonstrating the important roles of the Ca$^{2+}$-pump and background currents in the APs and bursts. This model provides acceptable fits to voltage-clamp, AP, and Ca$^{2+}$ concentration data based on in silico analysis.},

@article{Sharma2000,
abstract = {Studies with electron microscopy have shown that sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and mitochondria locate close to each other in cardiac muscle cells. We investigated the hypothesis that this proximity results in a transient exposure of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter (CaUP) to high concentrations of Ca$^{2+}$ following Ca$^{2+}$ release from the SR and thus an influx of Ca$^{2+}$ into mitochondria. Single ventricular myocytes of rat were skinned by exposing them to a physiological solution containing saponin (0.2 mg/ml). Cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]c) and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) were measured with fura-2 and rhod2, respectively. Application of caffeine (10 mM) induced a concomitant increase in [Ca$^{2+}$]c and [Ca$^{2+}$]m. Ruthenium red, at concentrations that block CaUP but not SR release, diminished the caffeine-induced increase in [Ca$^{2+}$]m but not [Ca$^{2+}$]c. In the presence of 1 mM BAPTA, a Ca$^{2+}$ chelator, the caffeine-induced increase in [Ca$^{2+}$]m was reduced substantially less than [Ca$^{2+}$]c. Moreover, inhibition of SR Ca$^{2+}$ pump with two different concentrations of thapsigargin caused an increase in [Ca$^{2+}$]m, which was related to the rate of [Ca$^{2+}$]c increase. Finally, electron microscopy showed that sites of junctions between SR and T tubules from which Ca$^{2+}$ is released, or Ca$^{2+}$ release units, CRUs, are preferentially located in close proximity to mitochondria. The distance between individual SR Ca$^{2+}$ release channels (feet or ryanodine receptors) is very short, ranging between approximately 37 and 270 nm. These results are consistent with the idea that there is a preferential coupling of Ca$^{2+}$ transport from SR to mitochondria in cardiac muscle cells, because of their structural proximity.},

abstract = {Several recent works show structurally and functionally dynamic contacts between mitochondria, the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, and other subcellular organelles. Many cellular processes require proper cooperation between the plasma membrane, the nucleus and subcellular vesicular/tubular networks such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. It has been suggested that such contacts are crucial for the synthesis and intracellular transport of phospholipids as well as for intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis, controlling fundamental processes like motility and contraction, secretion, cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis. Close contacts between smooth sub-domains of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria have been shown to be required also for maintaining mitochondrial structure. The overall distance between the associating organelle membranes as quantified by electron microscopy is small enough to allow contact formation by proteins present on their surfaces, allowing and regulating their interactions. In this review we give a historical overview of studies on organelle interactions, and summarize the present knowledge and hypotheses concerning their regulation and (patho)physiological consequences.},

abstract = {Store operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a principal cellular process by which cells regulate basal calcium, refill intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ stores, and execute a wide range of specialized activities. STIM and Orai proteins have been identified as the essential components enabling the reconstitution of Ca$^{2+}$ release-activated Ca$^{2+}$ (CRAC) channels that mediate SOCE. Here, we report the molecular identification of SARAF as a negative regulator of SOCE. Using heterologous expression, RNAi-mediated silencing and site directed mutagenesis combined with electrophysiological, biochemical and imaging techniques we show that SARAF is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane resident protein that associates with STIM to facilitate slow Ca$^{2+}$-dependent inactivation of SOCE. SARAF plays a key role in shaping cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ signals and determining the content of the major intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ stores, a role that is likely to be important in protecting cells from Ca$^{2+}$ overfilling.},

@article{Carafoli2001,
abstract = {In the course of evolution, Ca$^{2+}$ has emerged as the most versatile intracellular messenger. Its concentration within cells is controlled by reversible binding to specific classes of proteins that act as Ca$^{2+}$ sensors to decode its information before passing it on to targets. The decoding operation is based on specific conformational changes in the sensor proteins. Other proteins intrinsic to membranes simply control Ca$^{2+}$ concentration without processing its message, by transporting it across membrane boundaries. They are located in the plasma membrane and in the membranes of the organelles (the endo(sarco)plasmic reticulum, the mitochondria, the nuclear envelope), which play distinctive roles in the cellular homeostasis of Ca$^{2+}$. Ca$^{2+}$ is an ambivalent signaling agent. It carries information to virtually all processes important to cell life (e.g., it couples excitation to contraction, secretion, gene transcription, and controls enzyme activity through protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation), but also transmits signals that promote the programmed demise of cells. When escaping control, Ca$^{2+}$ also precipitates toxic cell death.},

abstract = {Calcium ions are of central importance in cellular physiology, as they carry the signal activating cells to perform their programmed function. Ca$^{2+}$ is particularly suitable for this role because of its chemical properties and because its free concentration gradient between the extra-cellular and the cytosolic concentrations is very high, about four orders of magnitude. The cytosolic concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ is regulated by binding and chelation by various substances and by transport across plasma and intracellular membranes. Various channels, transport ATPases, uniporters, and antiporters in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria are responsible for the transport of Ca$^{2+}$. The regulation of these transport systems is the subject of an increasing number of studies. In this short review, we focus on the mitochondrial transporters, i.e. the calcium uniporter used for Ca$^{2+}$ uptake, and the antiporters used for the efflux, i.e. the Ca$^{2+}$/Na(+) antiporter in mitochondria and the plasma membrane of excitable cells, and the Ca$^{2+}$/nH(+) antiporter in liver and some other mitochondrial types. Mitochondria are of special interest in that Ca$^{2+}$ stimulates respiration and oxidative phosphorylation to meet the energy needs of activated cells. The studies on Ca$^{2+}$ and mitochondria began in the fifties, but interest in mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling faded in the late seventies since it had become apparent that mitochondria in resting cells contain very low Ca$^{2+}$. Interest increased again in the nineties also because it was discovered that mitochondria and Ca$^{2+}$ had a central role in apoptosis and necrosis. This is of special interest in calcium overload and oxidative stress conditions, when the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore is stimulated.},

@article{Nix2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several problems exist with current methods used to align DNA sequences for comparative sequence analysis. Most dynamic programming algorithms assume that conserved sequence elements are collinear. This assumption appears valid when comparing orthologous protein coding sequences. Functional constraints on proteins provide strong selective pressure against sequence inversions, and minimize sequence duplications and feature shuffling. For non-coding sequences this collinearity assumption is often invalid. For example, enhancers contain clusters of transcription factor binding sites that change in number, orientation, and spacing during evolution yet the enhancer retains its activity. Dot plot analysis is often used to estimate non-coding sequence relatedness. Yet dot plots do not actually align sequences and thus cannot account well for base insertions or deletions. Moreover, they lack an adequate statistical framework for comparing sequence relatedness and are limited to pairwise comparisons. Lastly, dot plots and dynamic programming text outputs fail to provide an intuitive means for visualizing DNA alignments.

RESULTS: To address some of these issues, we created a stand alone, platform independent, graphic alignment tool for comparative sequence analysis (GATA http://gata.sourceforge.net/). GATA uses the NCBI-BLASTN program and extensive post-processing to identify all small sub-alignments above a low cut-off score. These are graphed as two shaded boxes, one for each sequence, connected by a line using the coordinate system of their parent sequence. Shading and colour are used to indicate score and orientation. A variety of options exist for querying, modifying and retrieving conserved sequence elements. Extensive gene annotation can be added to both sequences using a standardized General Feature Format (GFF) file.

CONCLUSIONS: GATA uses the NCBI-BLASTN program in conjunction with post-processing to exhaustively align two DNA sequences. It provides researchers with a fine-grained alignment and visualization tool aptly suited for non-coding, 0-200 kb, pairwise, sequence analysis. It functions independent of sequence feature ordering or orientation, and readily visualizes both large and small sequence inversions, duplications, and segment shuffling. Since the alignment is visual and does not contain gaps, gene annotation can be added to both sequences to create a thoroughly descriptive picture of DNA conservation that is well suited for comparative sequence analysis.},

abstract = {1. Intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ clearance mechanisms were studied in rat adrenal chromaffin cells, by measuring slow tail currents through small-conductance Ca$^{2+}$-activated K$^+$ channels and using indo-1 photometry following depolarization-induced Ca$^{2+}$ loading. 2. Following several-hundred millisecond depolarizations, [Ca$^{2+}$]i decayed in three phases. An initial fast decay was followed by a long-lasting, low plateau, then [Ca$^{2+}$]i returned to the resting level slowly. 3. Replacement of external Na$^+$ moderately slowed [Ca$^{2+}$]i decay, indicating a contribution of plasma membrane Na(+)-Ca$^{2+}$ exchange. 4. Raising external pH or application of extracellular Eosin of La3+ prolonged slow tail currents, indicating a contribution of plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase to Ca$^{2+}$ clearance. 5. Ca$^{2+}$-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release from caffeine-sensitive stores occurred during depolarization. 6. Inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase had little effect on Ca$^{2+}$ clearance. 7. Slow tail currents and [Ca$^{2+}$]i decay following 0.2 - 2 s depolarizations were much prolonged by mitochondrial inhibition with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or Ruthenium Red, which abolished the initial rapid decay and plateau of [Ca$^{2+}$]i. 8. In conclusion, mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake plays a major role in Ca$^{2+}$ clearance by rapidly and reversibly sequestering Ca$^{2+}$ during depolarization-evoked Ca$^{2+}$ loads.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction methods are increasingly used in biosciences to forecast diverse features and characteristics. Binary two-state classifiers are the most common applications. They are usually based on machine learning approaches. For the end user it is often problematic to evaluate the true performance and applicability of computational tools as some knowledge about computer science and statistics would be needed.

RESULTS: Instructions are given on how to interpret and compare method evaluation results. For systematic method performance analysis is needed established benchmark datasets which contain cases with known outcome, and suitable evaluation measures. The criteria for benchmark datasets are discussed along with their implementation in VariBench, benchmark database for variations. There is no single measure that alone could describe all the aspects of method performance. Predictions of genetic variation effects on DNA, RNA and protein level are important as information about variants can be produced much faster than their disease relevance can be experimentally verified. Therefore numerous prediction tools have been developed, however, systematic analyses of their performance and comparison have just started to emerge.

CONCLUSIONS: The end users of prediction tools should be able to understand how evaluation is done and how to interpret the results. Six main performance evaluation measures are introduced. These include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient. Together with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis they provide a good picture about the performance of methods and allow their objective and quantitative comparison. A checklist of items to look at is provided. Comparisons of methods for missense variant tolerance, protein stability changes due to amino acid substitutions, and effects of variations on mRNA splicing are presented.},

@article{Schuster2002,
abstract = {This review provides a comparative overview of recent developments in the modelling of cellular calcium oscillations. A large variety of mathematical models have been developed for this wide-spread phenomenon in intra- and intercellular signalling. From these, a general model is extracted that involves six types of concentration variables: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), cytoplasmic, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial calcium, the occupied binding sites of calcium buffers, and the fraction of active IP3 receptor calcium release channels. Using this framework, the models of calcium oscillations can be classified into 'minimal' models containing two variables and 'extended' models of three and more variables. Three types of minimal models are identified that are all based on calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), but differ with respect to the mechanisms limiting CICR. Extended models include IP3--calcium cross-coupling, calcium sequestration by mitochondria, the detailed gating kinetics of the IP3 receptor, and the dynamics of G-protein activation. In addition to generating regular oscillations, such models can describe bursting and chaotic calcium dynamics. The earlier hypothesis that information in calcium oscillations is encoded mainly by their frequency is nowadays modified in that some effect is attributed to amplitude encoding or temporal encoding. This point is discussed with reference to the analysis of the local and global bifurcations by which calcium oscillations can arise. Moreover, the question of how calcium binding proteins can sense and transform oscillatory signals is addressed. Recently, potential mechanisms leading to the coordination of oscillations in coupled cells have been investigated by mathematical modelling. For this, the general modelling framework is extended to include cytoplasmic and gap-junctional diffusion of IP3 and calcium, and specific models are compared. Various suggestions concerning the physiological significance of oscillatory behaviour in intra- and intercellular signalling are discussed. The article is concluded with a discussion of obstacles and prospects.},

abstract = {In human cells, Ero1-Lalpha and -Lbeta (hEROs) regulate oxidative protein folding by selectively oxidizing protein disulfide isomerase. Specific protein--protein interactions are probably crucial for regulating the formation, isomerization and reduction of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To identify molecules involved in ER redox control, we searched for proteins interacting with Ero1-Lalpha. Here, we characterize a novel ER resident protein (ERp44), which contains a thioredoxin domain with a CRFS motif and is induced during ER stress. ERp44 forms mixed disulfides with both hEROs and cargo folding intermediates. Whilst the interaction with transport-competent Ig-K chains is transient, ERp44 binds more stably with J chains, which are retained in the ER and eventually degraded by proteasomes. ERp44 does not bind a short-lived ribophorin mutant lacking cysteines. Its overexpression alters the equilibrium of the different Ero1-Lalpha redox isoforms, suggesting that ERp44 may be involved in the control of oxidative protein folding.},

abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) is a second messenger that induces the release of Ca$^{2+}$ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The IP(3) receptor (IP(3)R) was discovered as a developmentally regulated glyco-phosphoprotein, P400, that was missing in strains of mutant mice. IP(3)R can allosterically and dynamically change its form in a reversible manner. The crystal structures of the IP(3)-binding core and N-terminal suppressor sequence of IP(3)R have been identified. An IP(3) indicator (known as IP(3)R-based IP(3) sensor) was developed from the IP(3)-binding core. The IP(3)-binding core's affinity to IP(3) is very similar among the three isoforms of IP(3)R; instead, the N-terminal IP(3) binding suppressor region is responsible for isoform-specific IP(3)-binding affinity tuning. Various pathways for the trafficking of IP(3)R have been identified; for example, the ER forms a meshwork upon which IP(3)R moves by lateral diffusion, and vesicular ER subcompartments containing IP(3)R move rapidly along microtubles using a kinesin motor. Furthermore, IP(3)R mRNA within mRNA granules also moves along microtubules. IP(3)Rs are involved in exocrine secretion. ERp44 works as a redox sensor in the ER and regulates IP(3)R1 activity. IP(3) has been found to release Ca$^{2+}$, but it also releases IRBIT (IP(3)R-binding protein released with IP(3)). IRBIT is a pseudo-ligand for IP(3) that regulates the frequency and amplitude of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations through IP(3)R. IRBIT binds to pancreas-type Na, bicarbonate co-transporter 1, which is important for acid-base balance. The presence of many kinds of binding partners, like homer, protein 4.1N, huntingtin-associated protein-1A, protein phosphatases (PPI and PP2A), RACK1, ankyrin, chromogranin, carbonic anhydrase-related protein, IRBIT, Na,K-ATPase, and ERp44, suggest that IP(3)Rs form a macro signal complex and function as a center for signaling cascades. The structure of IP(3)R1, as revealed by cryoelectron microscopy, fits closely with these molecules.},

abstract = {The synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin 1 is thought to convey the calcium signal onto the core secretory machinery. Its cytosolic portion mainly consists of two C2 domains, which upon calcium binding are enabled to bind to acidic lipid bilayers. Despite major advances in recent years, it is still debated how synaptotagmin controls the process of neurotransmitter release. In particular, there is disagreement with respect to its calcium binding properties and lipid preferences. To investigate how the presence of membranes influences the calcium affinity of synaptotagmin, we have now measured these properties under equilibrium conditions using isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Our data demonstrate that the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), but not phosphatidylserine, markedly increases the calcium sensitivity of synaptotagmin. PI(4,5)P2 binding is confined to the C2B domain but is not affected significantly by mutations of a lysine-rich patch. Together, our findings lend support to the view that synaptotagmin functions by binding in a trans configuration whereby the C2A domain binds to the synaptic vesicle and the C2B binds to the PI(4,5)P2-enriched plasma membrane.},

abstract = {This paper presents mathematical models for the hepatocyte calcium oscillator which follow the concepts in a class of informal models developed to account for the striking dependence on the receptor type of several features of the calcium oscillations, in particular the shape and duration of the free calcium transients. The essence of these models is that the transients should be timed by a build-up of activated GTP-binding proteins, which, combined with positive feedback processes and perhaps with cooperative effects, leads to a sudden activation of phospholipase C (PLC), followed by negative feedback processes which switch off the calcium rise and lead to a fall in free calcium back to resting levels. These models predict pulsatile oscillations in inositol (1,4,5)P3 as well as in free calcium. We show that receptor-controlled intracellular calcium oscillators involving an unknown positive feedback pathway onto PLC and negative feedback from protein kinase C (PKC) onto G-proteins and receptors, or negative feedback by stimulation of GTPase activity can simulate many of the features of observed intracellular calcium oscillations. These oscillators exhibit a dependence of frequency on agonist concentration and a dependence of transient duration on receptor and G-protein type. We also show that a PLC-dependent GTPase activating factor (GAF) could provide explanations for some otherwise puzzling features of intracellular calcium oscillations.},

Here, we report that a wide variety of apoptotic and necrotic stimuli induce progressive mitochondrial swelling and outer mitochondrial membrane rupture. Discontinuity of the outer mitochondrial membrane results in cytochrome c redistribution from the intermembrane space to the cytosol followed by subsequent inner mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The mitochondrial membrane protein Bcl-xL can inhibit these changes in cells treated with apoptotic stimuli. In addition, Bcl-xL-expressing cells adapt to growth factor withdrawal or staurosporine treatment by maintaining a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Bcl-xL expression also prevents mitochondrial swelling in response to agents that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. These data suggest that Bcl-xL promotes cell survival by regulating the electrical and osmotic homeostasis of mitochondria.},

abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that propagation of cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$]c) spikes and oscillations to the mitochondria is important for the control of fundamental cellular functions. Delivery of [Ca$^{2+}$]c spikes to the mitochondria may utilize activation of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake sites by the large local [Ca$^{2+}$]c rise occurring in the vicinity of activated sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) Ca$^{2+}$ release channels. Although direct measurement of the local [Ca$^{2+}$]c sensed by the mitochondria has been difficult, recent studies shed some light onto the molecular mechanism of local Ca$^{2+}$ communication between SR/ER and mitochondria. Subdomains of the SR/ER are in close contact with mitochondria and display a concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ release sites, providing the conditions for an effective delivery of released Ca$^{2+}$ to the mitochondrial targets. Furthermore, many functional properties of the signalling between SR/ER Ca$^{2+}$ release sites and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake sites, including transient microdomains of high [Ca$^{2+}$], saturation of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake sites by released Ca$^{2+}$, connection of multiple release sites to each uptake site and quantal transmission, are analogous to the features of the coupling between neurotransmitter release sites and postsynaptic receptors in synaptic transmission. As such, Ca$^{2+}$ signal transmission between SR/ER and mitochondria may utilize discrete communication sites and a closely related functional architecture to that used for synaptic signal propagation between cells.},

The biophysical properties of mitochondrial calcium uptake have been studied in detail, but the underlying proteins remain elusive. Here we use an integrative strategy to predict human genes involved in mitochondrial calcium entry based on clues from comparative physiology, evolutionary genomics and organelle proteomics. RNA interference against 13 top candidates highlighted one gene, CBARA1, that we call hereafter mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1). Silencing MICU1 does not disrupt mitochondrial respiration or membrane potential but abolishes mitochondrial calcium entry in intact and permeabilized cells, and attenuates the metabolic coupling between cytosolic calcium transients and activation of matrix dehydrogenases. MICU1 is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and has two canonical EF hands that are essential for its activity, indicating a role in calcium sensing. MICU1 represents the founding member of a set of proteins required for high-capacity mitochondrial calcium uptake. Its discovery may lead to the complete molecular characterization of mitochondrial calcium uptake pathways, and offers genetic strategies for understanding their contribution to normal physiology and disease.},

The properties of the green fluorescent protein-based probes in terms of subcellular localization, photosensitivity, and Ca$^{2+}$ affinity have been analyzed in detail. It is concluded that the ratiometric pericam is, at present, the most reliable mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ probe for single cell studies, although this probe too is not devoid of problems. The results obtained with ratiometric pericam in single cells, combined with those obtained at the population level with aequorin, provide strong evidence demonstrating that the close vicinity of mitochondria to the Ca$^{2+}$ release channels (and thus responsible for the fast uptake of Ca$^{2+}$ by mitochondria upon receptor activation) are highly stable in time, suggesting the existence of specific interactions between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ as a signaling molecule carries information pivotal to cell life and death via its reversible interaction with a specific site in a protein. Although numerous Ca$^{2+}$-dependent activities are known, the proteins responsible for some of these activities remain unidentified. We synthesized and characterized a photoreactive reagent, azido ruthenium (AzRu), which interacts specifically with Ca$^{2+}$ binding proteins and strongly inhibits their Ca$^{2+}$-dependent activities, regardless of their catalytic mechanisms or functional state as purified proteins, embedded in the membrane or in intact cells. As expected from a Ca$^{2+}$ binding protein-specific reagent, AzRu had no effect on Ca$^{2+}$-independent and Mg2+-dependent activities. Az103Ru covalently bound, and specifically labeled, known Ca$^{2+}$ binding proteins. AzRu is a photoreactive reagent that provides an approach for identification of Ca$^{2+}$ binding proteins, characterization of their binding sites, and exploration of new Ca$^{2+}$-dependent processes.},

abstract = {Capacitative regulation of calcium entry is a major mechanism of Ca$^{2+}$ influx into electrically non-excitable cells, but it also operates in some excitable ones. It participates in the refilling of intracellular calcium stores and in the generation of Ca$^{2+}$ signals in excited cells. The mechanism which couples depletion of intracellular calcium stores located in the endoplasmic reticulum with opening of store-operated calcium channels in the plasma membrane is not clearly understood. Mitochondria located in close proximity to Ca$^{2+}$ channels are exposed to high Ca$^{2+}$ concentration, and therefore, they are able to accumulate this cation effectively. This decreases local Ca$^{2+}$ concentration and thereby affects calcium-dependent processes, such as depletion and refilling of the intracellular calcium stores and opening of the store-operated channels. Finally, mitochondria modulate the intensity and the duration of calcium signals induced by extracellular stimuli. Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by mitochondria requires these organelles to be in the energized state. On the other hand, Ca$^{2+}$ flux into mitochondria stimulates energy metabolism. To sum up, mitochondria couple cellular metabolism with calcium homeostasis and signaling.},

abstract = {Several apoptotic regulators, including Bcl-x, are alternatively spliced to produce isoforms with opposite functions. We have used an RNA interference strategy to map the regulatory landscape controlling the expression of the Bcl-x splice variants in human cells. Depleting proteins known as core (Y14 and eIF4A3) or auxiliary (RNPS1, Acinus, and SAP18) components of the exon junction complex (EJC) improved the production of the proapoptotic Bcl-x(S) splice variant. This effect was not seen when we depleted EJC proteins that typically participate in mRNA export (UAP56, Aly/Ref, and TAP) or that associate with the EJC to enforce nonsense-mediated RNA decay (MNL51, Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3b). Core and auxiliary EJC components modulated Bcl-x splicing through different cis-acting elements, further suggesting that this activity is distinct from the established EJC function. In support of a direct role in splicing control, recombinant eIF4A3, Y14, and Magoh proteins associated preferentially with the endogenous Bcl-x pre-mRNA, interacted with a model Bcl-x pre-mRNA in early splicing complexes, and specifically shifted Bcl-x alternative splicing in nuclear extracts. Finally, the depletion of Y14, eIF4A3, RNPS1, SAP18, and Acinus also encouraged the production of other proapoptotic splice variants, suggesting that EJC-associated components are important regulators of apoptosis acting at the alternative splicing level.},

We have studied the effect of a natural bile acid, taurolithocholate (TLC), and its sulphated form, taurolithocholate 3-sulphate (TLC-S), on [Ca$^{2+}$]i in single isolated rat hepatocytes. Although these bile acids are believed to act through a common mechanism to permeabilize the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ pool, the [Ca$^{2+}$]i responses induced by the two compounds were different. Whereas TLC induced a sustained elevation of [Ca$^{2+}$]i, TLC-S evoked repetitive [Ca$^{2+}$]i oscillations. In addition, we show that ryanodine, which blocks the Ca$^{2+}$-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release ('CICR') mechanism, blocked TLC-S-induced oscillations in 50\% of hepatocytes, but did not affect the TLC-induced rise in [Ca$^{2+}$]i.},

abstract = {Hormone-induced oscillations of the free intracellular calcium concentration are thought to be relevant for frequency encoding of hormone signals. In liver cells, such Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations occur in response to stimulation by hormones acting via phosphoinositide breakdown. This observation may be explained by cooperative, positive feedback of Ca$^{2+}$ on its own release from one inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive pool, obviating oscillations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The kinetic rate laws of the associated model have a mathematical structure reminiscent of the Brusselator, a hypothetical chemical model involving a rather improbable trimolecular reaction step, thus giving a realistic biological interpretation to this hallmark of dissipative structures. We propose that calmodulin is involved in mediating this cooperativity and positive feedback, as suggested by the presented experiments. For one, hormone-induced calcium oscillations can be inhibited by the (nonphenothiazine) calmodulin antagonists calmidazolium or CGS 9343 B. Alternatively, in cells overstimulated by hormone, as characterized by a non-oscillatory elevated Ca$^{2+}$ concentration, these antagonists could again restore sustained calcium oscillations. The experimental observations, including modulation of the oscillations by extracellular calcium, were in qualitative agreement with the predictions of our mathematical model.},

The SER can also be functionally segregated into domains that regulate ER-Golgi traffic (transitional ER), ERAD (ER-associated degradation), sterol and lipid biosynthesis and calcium sequestration. The last two, as well as apoptosis, are critically regulated by the close association of the SER with mitochondria. Studies with AMFR (autocrine motility factor receptor) have defined an SER domain whose integrity and mitochondrial association can be modulated by ilimaquinone as well as by free cytosolic calcium levels in the normal physiological range. AMFR is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets its ligand directly to the SER via a caveolae/raft-dependent pathway. In the present review, we will address the relationship between the calcium-dependent morphology and mitochondrial association of the SER and its various functional roles in the cell.},

abstract = {Modeling and simulation of the calcium signaling events that precede long-term depression of synaptic activity in cerebellar Purkinje cells are performed using the Virtual Cell biological modeling framework. It is found that the unusually high density and low sensitivity of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) are critical to the ability of the cell to generate and localize a calcium spike in a single dendritic spine. The results also demonstrate the model's capability to simulate the supralinear calcium spike observed experimentally during coincident activation of the parallel and climbing fibers. The sensitivity of the calcium spikes to certain biological and geometrical effects is investigated as well as the mechanisms that underlie the cell's ability to generate the supralinear spike. The sensitivity of calcium release rates from the IP3R to calcium concentrations, as well as IP3 concentrations, allows the calcium spike to form. The diffusion barrier caused by the small radius of the spine neck is shown to be important, as a threshold radius is observed above which a spike cannot be formed. Additionally, the calcium buffer capacity and diffusion rates from the spine are found to be important parameters in shaping the calcium spike.},

abstract = {Calcium ions are an important second messenger in living cells. Indeed calcium signals in the form of waves have been the subject of much recent experimental interest. It is now well established that these waves are composed of elementary stochastic release events (calcium puffs or sparks) from spatially localised calcium stores. The aim of this paper is to analyse how the stochastic nature of individual receptors within these stores combines to create stochastic behaviour on long time-scales that may ultimately lead to waves of activity in a spatially extended cell model. Techniques from asymptotic analysis and stochastic phase-plane analysis are used to show that a large cluster of receptor channels leads to a release probability with a sigmoidal dependence on calcium density. This release probability is incorporated into a computationally inexpensive model of calcium release based upon a stochastic generalisation of the fire-diffuse-fire (FDF) threshold model. Numerical simulations of the model in one and two dimensions (with stores arranged on both regular and disordered lattices) illustrate that stochastic calcium release leads to the spontaneous production of calcium sparks that may merge to form saltatory waves. Illustrations of spreading circular waves, spirals and more irregular waves are presented. Furthermore, receptor noise is shown to generate a form of array enhanced coherence resonance whereby all calcium stores release periodically and simultaneously.},

abstract = {Simulation and modeling is becoming more and more important when studying complex biochemical systems. Most often, ordinary differential equations are employed for this purpose. However, these are only applicable when the numbers of participating molecules in the biochemical systems are large enough to be treated as concentrations. For smaller systems, stochastic simulations on discrete particle basis are more accurate. Unfortunately, there are no general rules for determining which method should be employed for exactly which problem to get the most realistic result. Therefore, we study the transition from stochastic to deterministic behavior in a widely studied system, namely the signal transduction via calcium, especially calcium oscillations. We observe that the transition occurs within a range of particle numbers, which roughly corresponds to the number of receptors and channels in the cell, and depends heavily on the attractive properties of the phase space of the respective systems dynamics. We conclude that the attractive properties of a system, expressed, e.g., by the divergence of the system, are a good measure for determining which simulation algorithm is appropriate in terms of speed and realism.},

abstract = {We present a refined model of the membrane-associated Torpedo acetylcholine (ACh) receptor at 4A resolution. An improved experimental density map was obtained from 342 electron images of helical tubes, and the refined structure was derived to an R-factor of 36.7\% (R(free) 37.9\%) by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell. The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm that the two ligand-binding alpha subunits have a different extended conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel, and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces, and within the alpha subunits, which may be responsible for their "distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains of the alpha subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison of the structure of the alpha subunit with that of AChBP having ligand present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative, providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size.},

abstract = {We have developed a mathematical model that describes several aspects of agonist-induced Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in single pituitary gonadotrophs. Our model is based on fast activation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor Ca$^{2+}$ channels at low free cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]i) and slow inactivation at high [Ca$^{2+}$]i. Previous work has shown that these gating properties, when combined with a Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase, are sufficient to generate simulated Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. The Hodgkin-Huxley-like description we formulate here incorporates these different gating properties explicitly and renders their effects transparent and easy to modulate. We introduce regulatory mechanisms of channel opening which enable the model, both in the absence and in the presence of Ca$^{2+}$ entry, to give responses to a wide range of agonist doses that are in good agreement with experimental findings, including subthreshold responses, superthreshold oscillations with frequency determined by [InsP3], and nonoscillatory "biphasic" responses followed occasionally by small-amplitude oscillations. A particular added feature of our model, enhanced channel opening by reduced concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, allows oscillations to continue during pool depletion. The model predicts that ionomycin and thapsigargin can induce oscillations with basal [InsP3] and zero Ca$^{2+}$ entry, while Ca$^{2+}$ injection cannot. Responses to specific pairings of sub- or superthreshold stimuli of agonist, ionomycin, and thapsigargin are also correctly predicted. Since this model encompasses a wide range of observed dynamic behaviors within a single framework, based on well-established mechanisms, its relevance should not be restricted to gonadotrophs.},

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Despite more than 30 years of research, no pharmacological agents have been identified that improve neurological function following TBI. However, several lines of research described in this review provide support for further development of voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) antagonists as potential therapeutic agents. Following TBI, neurons and astrocytes experience a rapid and sometimes enduring increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca$^{2+}$]i). These fluxes in [Ca$^{2+}$]i drive not only apoptotic and necrotic cell death, but also can lead to long-term cell dysfunction in surviving cells. In a limited number of in vitro experiments, both L-type and N-type VGCC antagonists successfully reduced calcium loads as well as neuronal and astrocytic cell death following mechanical injury. In rodent models of TBI, administration of VGCC antagonists reduced cell death and improved cognitive function. It is clear that there is a critical need to find effective therapeutics and rational drug delivery strategies for the management and treatment of TBI, and we believe that further investigation of VGCC antagonists should be pursued before ruling out the possibility of successful translation to the clinic.},

abstract = {The ability of mitochondria to capture Ca$^{2+}$ ions has important functional implications for cells, because mitochondria shape cellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals by acting as a Ca$^{2+}$ buffer and respond to Ca$^{2+}$ elevations either by increasing the cell energy supply or by triggering the cell death program of apoptosis. A mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ channel known as the uniporter drives the rapid and massive entry of Ca$^{2+}$ ions into mitochondria. The uniporter operates at high, micromolar cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations that are only reached transiently in cells, near Ca$^{2+}$ release channels. Mitochondria can also take up Ca$^{2+}$ at low, nanomolar concentrations, but this high affinity mode of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake is not well characterized. Recently, leucine-zipper-EF hand-containing transmembrane region (Letm1) was proposed to be an electrogenic 1:1 mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$/H+ antiporter that drives the uptake of Ca$^{2+}$ into mitochondria at nanomolar cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations. In this article, we will review the properties of the Ca$^{2+}$ import systems of mitochondria and discuss how Ca$^{2+}$ uptake via an electrogenic 1:1 Ca$^{2+}$/H+ antiport challenges our current thinking of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake mechanism.},

In C. elegans CRT-1 is expressed in the intestine, pharynx, body-wall muscles, head neurons, coelomocytes, and in sperm. crt-1 males exhibit reduced mating efficiency and defects late in sperm development in addition to defects in oocyte development and/or somatic gonad function in hermaphrodites.

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing data generation demands the development of methods for interpreting the effects of genomic variants. Numerous computational methods have been developed to assess the impact of variations because experimental methods are unable to cope with both the speed and volume of data generation. To harness the strength of currently available predictors, the Pathogenic-or-Not-Pipeline (PON-P) integrates five predictors to predict the probability that nonsynonymous variations affect protein function and may consequently be disease related. Random forest methodology-based PON-P shows consistently improved performance in cross-validation tests and on independent test sets, providing ternary classification and statistical reliability estimate of results. Applied to missense variants in a melanoma cancer cell line, PON-P predicts variants in 17 genes to affect protein function. Previous studies implicate nine of these genes in the pathogenesis of various forms of cancer. PON-P may thus be used as a first step in screening and prioritizing variants to determine deleterious ones for further experimentation.},

Decreasing the effective diffusion coefficient of free Ca$^{2+}$ using Ca$^{2+}$ buffers increases the average ISI and the standard deviation in agreement with the idea that individual spikes are caused by random wave nucleation.

abstract = {Mechanisms of blockade of two types of Ca$^{2+}$ channels by the organic Ca$^{2+}$ antagonists, nicardipine, diltiazem, verapamil, and flunarizine, were examined in rat aorta smooth muscle cells in primary culture by using the whole-cell voltage-clamp method. T-type Ca$^{2+}$ current (T-type ICa) was isolated by an internal perfusion of 5 mM F-, which irreversibly suppressed the L-type ICa, without affecting T-type ICa. L-type ICa was isolated by setting a holding potential at -60 mV, at which most of the T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels were inactivated. L-type ICa is halved by 0.1 microM nicardipine, 3.0 microM diltiazem, 0.6 microM verapamil, and 0.1 microM flunarizine, whereas T-type ICa is halved by the same drugs at 0.6, 30, 30, and 0.1 microM, respectively. Diltiazem and verapamil accelerated the decay of L-type ICa and cumulatively blocked L-type ICa during repetitive step depolarizations elicited every 30 seconds ("use-dependent block"). Diltiazem and verapamil neither changed the decay of T-type ICa nor showed a use-dependent block of T-type ICa. Nicardipine and flunarizine blocked both L- and T-type ICa from the first depolarization step after drug treatment ("tonic block") and shifted their steady-state inactivation curves to the left. The estimated binding constants of nicardipine and flunarizine for the inactivated state of T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels (48 and 19 nM, respectively) were smaller than those for the resting state of L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels (160 and 90 nM, respectively). A low concentration (0.1 microM) of nicardipine initially potentiated T-type ICa and then reduced it. We conclude from these results that 1) nicardipine and flunarizine block not only the resting state but, more preferentially, the inactivated state of both the L- and T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels; 2) verapamil and diltiazem preferentially act on the open state of the L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel and on the resting and inactivated state of the T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel; and 3) the T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel of the rat aorta smooth muscle cells appears to be more sensitive to nicardipine and flunarizine than does the L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel at around the resting membrane potential.},

abstract = {The four basic isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$ pump and the two C-terminally truncated spliced variants PMCA4CII(4a) and 3CII(3a) were transiently overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells together with aequorin targeted to the cytosol, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the mitochondria. As PMCA3CII(3a) had not yet been cloned and studied, it was cloned for this study, partially purified, and characterized. At variance with the corresponding truncated variant of PMCA4, which had been studied previously, PMCA3CII(3a) had very high calmodulin affinity. All four basic pump variants influenced the homeostasis of Ca$^{2+}$ in the native intracellular environment. The level of [Ca$^{2+}$] in the endoplasmic reticulum and the height of the [Ca$^{2+}$] transients generated in the cytosol and in the mitochondria by the emptying of the endoplasmic reticulum store by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were all reduced by the overexpression of the pumps. The effects were much greater with the neuron-specific PMCA2 and PMCA3 than with the ubiquitously expressed isoforms 1 and 4. Unexpectedly, the truncated PMCA3 and PMCA4 were as effective as the full-length variants in influencing the homeostasis of Ca$^{2+}$ in the cytosol and the organelles. In particular, PMCA4CII(4a) was as effective as PMCA4CI(4b), even if its affinity for calmodulin is much lower. The results indicate that the availability of calmodulin may not be critical for the modulation of PMCA pumps in vivo.},

@article{Meyer1988,
abstract = {Many cells exhibit periodic transient increases in cytosolic calcium levels rather than a sustained rise when stimulated by a hormone or growth factor. We propose here a molecular model that accounts for periodic calcium spiking induced by a constant stimulus. Four elements give rise to repetitive calcium transients: cooperativity and positive feedback between a pair of reciprocally coupled (crosscoupled) messengers, followed by deactivation and then by reactivation. The crosscoupled messengers in our model are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and cytosolic calcium ions. The opening of calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum by the binding of multiple molecules of InsP3 provides the required cooperativity. The stimulation of receptor-activated phospholipase C by released calcium ions leads to positive feedback. InsP3 is destroyed by a phosphatase, and calcium ion is pumped back into the endoplasmic reticulum. These processes generate bistability: the cytosolic calcium concentration abruptly increases from a basal level to a stimulated level at a threshold degree of activation of phospholipase C. Spiking further requires slow deactivation and subsequent reactivation. In our model, mitochondrial sequestration of calcium ion prevents the cytosolic level from increasing above several micromolar and enables the system to return to the basal state. When the endoplasmic reticulum calcium store is refilled to a critical level by the Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase pump, cooperative positive feedback between the InsP3-gated channel and phospholipase C begins again to give the next calcium spike. The time required for the calcium level in the endoplasmic reticulum to reach a threshold sets the interval between spikes. The amplitude, shape, and period of calcium spikes calculated for this model are like those observed experimentally.},

abstract = {In electrically nonexcitable cells, Ca$^{2+}$ influx is essential for regulating a host of kinetically distinct processes involving exocytosis, enzyme control, gene regulation, cell growth and proliferation, and apoptosis. The major Ca$^{2+}$ entry pathway in these cells is the store-operated one, in which the emptying of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ stores activates Ca$^{2+}$ influx (store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry, or capacitative Ca$^{2+}$ entry). Several biophysically distinct store-operated currents have been reported, but the best characterized is the Ca$^{2+}$ release-activated Ca$^{2+}$ current, I(CRAC). Although it was initially considered to function only in nonexcitable cells, growing evidence now points towards a central role for I(CRAC)-like currents in excitable cells too. In spite of intense research, the signal that relays the store Ca$^{2+}$ content to CRAC channels in the plasma membrane, as well as the molecular identity of the Ca$^{2+}$ sensor within the stores, remains elusive. Resolution of these issues would be greatly helped by the identification of the CRAC channel gene. In some systems, evidence suggests that store-operated channels might be related to TRP homologs, although no consensus has yet been reached. Better understood are mechanisms that inactivate store-operated entry and hence control the overall duration of Ca$^{2+}$ entry. Recent work has revealed a central role for mitochondria in the regulation of I(CRAC), and this is particularly prominent under physiological conditions. I(CRAC) therefore represents a dynamic interplay between endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and plasma membrane. In this review, we describe the key electrophysiological features of I(CRAC) and other store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ currents and how they are regulated, and we consider recent advances that have shed insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in this ubiquitous and vital Ca$^{2+}$ entry pathway.},

abstract = {Microdomains of calcium (i.e., areas on the nanometer scale that have qualitatively different calcium concentrations from that in the bulk cytosol) are known to be important in many situations. In cardiac cells, for instance, a calcium microdomain between the L-type channels and the ryanodine receptors, the so-called diadic cleft, is where the majority of the control of calcium release occurs. In other cell types that exhibit calcium oscillations and waves, the importance of microdomains in the vicinity of clusters of inositol trisphosphate receptors, or between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other internal organelles or the plasma membrane, is clear. Given the limits of computational power, it is not currently realistic to model an entire cellular cytoplasm by incorporating detailed structural information about the ER throughout the entire cytoplasm. Hence, most models use a homogenised approach, assuming that both cytoplasm and ER coexist at each point of the domain. Conversely, microdomain models can be constructed, in which detailed structural information can be incorporated, but, until now, methods have not been developed for linking such a microdomain model to a model at the level of the entire cell. Using the homogenisation approach we developed in an earlier paper [Goel, P., Friedman, A., Sneyd, J., 2006. Homogenization of the cell cytoplasm: the calcium bidomain equations. SIAM J. Multiscale Modeling Simulation, in press] we show how a multiscale model of a calcium microdomain can be constructed. In this model a detailed model of the microdomain (in which the ER and the cytoplasm are separate compartments) is coupled to a homogenised model of the entire cell in a rigorous way. Our method is illustrated by a simple model of the diadic cleft of a cardiac half-sarcomere.},

This interest in cell signaling began with studies on the control of fluid secretion by an insect salivary gland, and the subsequent quest led to the discovery of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and its role in calcium signaling, which effectively divided my scientific career into two distinct parts. The first part was primarily experimental and culminated in the discovery of IP3, which set the agenda for the second half during which I have enjoyed exploring the many functions of this remarkably versatile signaling system. It has been particularly exciting to find out how this IP3/Ca$^{2+}$ signaling pathway has been adapted to control processes as diverse as fertilization, proliferation, cell contraction, secretion, and information processing in neuronal cells.},

abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common form of genetic variation in humans. The number of SNPs identified in the human genome is growing rapidly, but attaining experimental knowledge about the possible disease association of variants is laborious and time-consuming. Several computational methods have been developed for the classification of SNPs according to their predicted pathogenicity. In this study, we have evaluated the performance of nine widely used pathogenicity prediction methods available on the Internet. The evaluated methods were MutPred, nsSNPAnalyzer, Panther, PhD-SNP, PolyPhen, PolyPhen2, SIFT, SNAP, and SNPs\&GO. The methods were tested with a set of over 40,000 pathogenic and neutral variants. We also assessed whether the type of original or substituting amino acid residue, the structural class of the protein, or the structural environment of the amino acid substitution, had an effect on the prediction performance. The performances of the programs ranged from poor (MCC 0.19) to reasonably good (MCC 0.65), and the results from the programs correlated poorly. The overall best performing methods in this study were SNPs\&GO and MutPred, with accuracies reaching 0.82 and 0.81, respectively.},

@article{Sardet2007,
abstract = {The dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes of the ascidian embryo are defined before first cleavage by means of a series of reorganizations that reposition cytoplasmic and cortical domains established during oogenesis. These domains situated in the periphery of the oocyte contain developmental determinants and a population of maternal postplasmic/PEM RNAs. One of these RNAs (macho-1) is a determinant for the muscle cells of the tadpole embryo. Oocytes acquire a primary animal-vegetal (a-v) axis during meiotic maturation, when a subcortical mitochondria-rich domain (myoplasm) and a domain rich in cortical endoplasmic reticulum (cER) and maternal postplasmic/PEM RNAs (cER-mRNA domain) become polarized and asymmetrically enriched in the vegetal hemisphere. Fertilization at metaphase of meiosis I initiates a series of dramatic cytoplasmic and cortical reorganizations of the zygote, which occur in two major phases. The first major phase depends on sperm entry which triggers a calcium wave leading in turn to an actomyosin-driven contraction wave. The contraction concentrates the cER-mRNA domain and myoplasm in and around a vegetal/contraction pole. The precise localization of the vegetal/contraction pole depends on both the a-v axis and the location of sperm entry and prefigures the future site of gastrulation and dorsal side of the embryo. The second major phase of reorganization occurs between meiosis completion and first cleavage. Sperm aster microtubules and then cortical microfilaments cause the cER-mRNA domain and myoplasm to reposition toward the posterior of the zygote. The location of the posterior pole depends on the localization of the sperm centrosome/aster attained during the first major phase of reorganization. Both cER-mRNA and myoplasm domains localized in the posterior region are partitioned equally between the first two blastomeres and then asymmetrically over the next two cleavages. At the eight-cell stage the cER-mRNA domain compacts and gives rise to a macroscopic cortical structure called the Centrosome Attracting Body (CAB). The CAB is responsible for a series of unequal divisions in posterior-vegetal blastomeres, and the postplasmic/PEM RNAs it contains are involved in patterning the posterior region of the embryo. In this review, we discuss these multiple events and phases of reorganizations in detail and their relationship to physiological, cell cycle, and cytoskeletal events. We also examine the role of the reorganizations in localizing determinants, postplasmic/PEM RNAs, and PAR polarity proteins in the cortex. Finally, we summarize some of the remaining questions concerning polarization of the ascidian embryo and provide comparisons to a few other species. A large collection of films illustrating the reorganizations can be consulted by clicking on "Film archive: ascidian eggs and embryos" at http://biodev.obs-vlfr.fr/recherche/biomarcell/.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ sequestration is a well-known process that is involved in various physiological and pathological mechanisms. Using isolated suspended mitochondria one unique mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter was considered to account ubiquitously for the transfer of Ca$^{2+}$ into these organelles. However, by applying alternative techniques for measuring mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake evidences for molecularly distinct mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ carriers accumulated recently. Herein we compared different methodical approaches of studying mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. Patch clamp technique on mitoplasts from endothelial and HeLa cells revealed the existence of three and two mitoplast Ca$^{2+}$ currents (I(CaMito)), respectively. According to their conductance, these channels were named small (s-), intermediate (i-), large (l-) and extra-large (xl-) mitoplast Ca$^{2+}$ currents (MCC). i-MCC was found in mitoplasts of both cell types whereas s-MCC and l-MCC or xl-MCC were/was exclusively found in mitoplasts from endothelial cells or HeLa cells. The comparison of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ signals, measured either indirectly by sensing extra-mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ or directly by recording changes of the matrix Ca$^{2+}$, showed different Ca$^{2+}$ sensitivities of the distinct mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake routes. Subpopulations of mitochondria with different Ca$^{2+}$ uptake capacities in intact endothelial cells could be identified using Rhod-2/AM. In contrast, cells expressing mitochondrial targeted pericam or cameleon (4mtD3cpv) showed homogeneous mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ signals in response to cell stimulation. The comparison of different experimental approaches and protocols using isolated organelles, permeabilized and intact cells, pointed to cell-type specific and versatile pathways for mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. Moreover, this work highlights the necessity of the utilization of multiple technical approaches to study the complexity of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis.},

abstract = {Treatment of hepatocytes with agonists which act via the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), results in increases of cytosolic free Ca$^{2+}$ [( Ca$^{2+}$]i) which are manifest as a series of discrete [Ca$^{2+}$]i transients or oscillations. With increasing agonist dose [Ca$^{2+}$]i oscillation frequency increases and the initial latent period decreases, but the amplitude of the [Ca$^{2+}$]i oscillations remains constant. Studies of these [Ca$^{2+}$]i oscillations at the subcellular level have indicated that the [Ca$^{2+}$]i changes do not occur synchronously throughout the cell, but initiate at a specific subcellular domain, adjacent to a region of the plasma membrane, and then propagate through the cell as a [Ca$^{2+}$]i wave. For a given ceil, the locus of [Ca$^{2+}$]i wave initiation is constant for every oscillation in a series and is also identical when the cell is sequentially stimulated with different agonists or when the phospholipase C-linked G protein is activated directly using AIF4-. The kinetics of the [Ca$^{2+}$]i waves indicate that a Ca$^{2+}$-activated mechanism is involved in propagating the oscillatory [Ca$^{2+}$]i increases throughout the cell, and the data appear to be most consistent with a process of Ca$^{2+}$-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release. It is proposed that the ability to propagate [Ca$^{2+}$]i oscillations into regions of the cell distal to the region in which the signal transduction apparatus is localized could serve an important function in allowing all parts of the cell to respond to the stimulus.},

With regard to spatial organization, signalling components are highly organized with respect to their cellular location and how they transmit information from one region of the cell to another. This spatial organization of signalling pathways depends on the molecular interactions that occur between signalling components that use signal transduction domains to construct signalling pathways. Very often, the components responsible for information transfer mechanisms are held in place by being attached to scaffolding proteins to form macromolecular signalling complexes . Sometimes these macromolecular complexes can be organized further by being localized to specific regions of the cell, as found in lipid rafts and caveolae or in the T-tubule regions of skeletal and cardiac cells.10.1042/csb0001006},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, one major route for Ca$^{2+}$ influx is through store-operated CRAC channels, which are activated following a fall in Ca$^{2+}$ content within the endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondria are key regulators of this ubiquitous Ca$^{2+}$ influx pathway. Respiring mitochondria rapidly take up some of the Ca$^{2+}$ released from the stores, resulting in more extensive store depletion and thus robust activation of CRAC channels. As CRAC channels open, the ensuing rise in cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ feeds back to inactivate the channels. By buffering some of the incoming Ca$^{2+}$ mitochondria reduce Ca$^{2+}$-dependent inactivation of the CRAC channels, resulting in more prolonged Ca$^{2+}$ influx. However, mitochondria can release Ca$^{2+}$ close to the endoplasmic reticulum, accelerating store refilling and thus promoting deactivation of the CRAC channels. Mitochondria thus regulate all major transitions in CRAC channel gating, revealing remarkable versatility in how this organelle impacts upon Ca$^{2+}$ influx. Recent evidence suggests that mitochondria also control CRAC channels through mechanisms that are independent of their Ca$^{2+}$-buffering actions and ability to generate ATP. Furthermore, pyruvic acid, a key intermediary metabolite and precursor substrate for the Krebs cycle, reduces the extent of Ca$^{2+}$-dependent inactivation of CRAC channels. Hence mitochondrial metabolism impacts upon Ca$^{2+}$ influx through CRAC channels and thus on a range of key downstream cellular responses.},

During apoptosis, the mitochondria also release AIF and endonuclease G, both of which are translocated to the nucleus and are implicated in apoptotic nuclear changes that occur in a caspase-independent manner. Mitochondrial membrane permeability is directly controlled by the major apoptosis regulator, i.e., the Bcl-2 family of proteins, mainly through regulation of the formation of apoptotic protein-conducting pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane, although the precise molecular mechanisms are still not completely understood.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study examines the effects of sleep restricted to four hours for three consecutive nights on blood parameters, known to be associated with cardiovascular risk, in young healthy men.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight young healthy men (age 24.5 +/- 3.3 years) were studied in the sleep restricted group. Nine young healthy men (age 24 +/- 2 years) were included in the control group and spent the days and nights in the sleep lab, while sleeping eight hours/night. One baseline night was followed by three nights of sleep restriction to four hours and by one recovery night of eight hours. Blood samplings were performed after the baseline night and after the third night of sleep restriction or without restriction for the control group.

RESULTS: A significant increase in white blood cells (WBC) (5.79 +/- 1.05 vs. 6.89 +/- 1.31 10(3) cell/microl, p = 0.03), and neutrophils (3.17 +/- 0.69 vs 4.24 +/- 0.97 10(3) cell/microl, p = 0.01) was observed after the third night of sleep restriction.

CONCLUSION: Sleep restriction affected WBC count, mainly neutrophils, considered as risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Stress induced by the short term sleep restriction could be involved in this observation.},

abstract = {Ryanodine receptors are large channels that release Ca$^{2+}$ from the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Hundreds of RyR mutations can cause cardiac and skeletal muscle disorders, yet detailed mechanisms explaining their effects have been lacking. Here we compare pseudo-atomic models and propose that channel opening coincides with widening of a cytoplasmic vestibule formed by the N-terminal region, thus altering an interface targeted by 20 disease mutations. We solve crystal structures of several disease mutants that affect intrasubunit domain-domain interfaces. Mutations affecting intrasubunit ionic pairs alter relative domain orientations, and thus couple to surrounding interfaces. Buried disease mutations cause structural changes that also connect to the intersubunit contact area. These results suggest that the intersubunit contact region between N-terminal domains is a prime target for disease mutations, direct or indirect, and we present a model whereby ryanodine receptors and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are activated by altering domain arrangements in the N-terminal region.},

abstract = {Along with a large number of carriers, exchangers and "pumps", the inner mitochondrial membrane contains ion-conducting channels which endow it with controlled permeability to small ions. Some have been shown to be the mitochondrial counterpart of channels present also in other cellular membranes. The manuscript summarizes the current state of knowledge on the major inner mitochondrial membrane channels, properties, identity and proposed functions. Considerable attention is currently being devoted to two K(+)-selective channels, mtK(ATP) and mtBK(Ca). Their activation in "preconditioning" is considered by many to underlie the protection of myocytes and other cells against subsequent ischemic damage. We have recently shown that in apoptotic lymphocytes inner membrane mtK(V)1.3 interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax after the latter has inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Whether the just-discovered mtIK(Ca) has similar cellular role(s) remains to be seen. The Ca$^{2+}$ "uniporter" has been characterized electrophysiologically, but still awaits a molecular identity. Chloride-selective channels are represented by the 107 pS channel, the first mitochondrial channel to be observed by patch-clamp, and by a approximately 400 pS pore we have recently been able to fully characterize in the inner membrane of mitochondria isolated from a colon tumour cell line. This we propose to represent a component of the Permeability Transition Pore. The available data exclude the previous tentative identification with porin, and indicate that it coincides instead with the still molecularly unidentified "maxi" chloride channel.},

abstract = {Mammalian Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchangers are members of three branches of a much larger family of transport proteins [the CaCA (Ca$^{2+}$/cation antiporter) superfamily] whose main role is to provide control of Ca$^{2+}$ flux across the plasma membranes or intracellular compartments. Since cytosolic levels of Ca$^{2+}$ are much lower than those found extracellularly or in sequestered stores, the major function of Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchangers is to extrude Ca$^{2+}$ from the cytoplasm. The exchangers are, however, fully reversible and thus, under special conditions of subcellular localization and compartmentalized ion gradients, Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchangers may allow Ca$^{2+}$ entry and may play more specialized roles in Ca$^{2+}$ movement between compartments. The NCX (Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger) [SLC (solute carrier) 8] branch of Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchangers comprises three members: NCX1 has been most extensively studied, and is broadly expressed with particular abundance in heart, brain and kidney, NCX2 is expressed in brain, and NCX3 is expressed in brain and skeletal muscle. The NCX proteins subserve a variety of roles, depending upon the site of expression. These include cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, neuronal signalling and Ca$^{2+}$ reabsorption in the kidney. The NCKX (Na2+/Ca$^{2+}$-K$^+$ exchanger) (SLC24) branch of Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchangers transport K$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ in exchange for Na$^+$, and comprises five members: NCKX1 is expressed in retinal rod photoreceptors, NCKX2 is expressed in cone photoreceptors and in neurons throughout the brain, NCKX3 and NCKX4 are abundant in brain, but have a broader tissue distribution, and NCKX5 is expressed in skin, retinal epithelium and brain. The NCKX proteins probably play a particularly prominent role in regulating Ca$^{2+}$ flux in environments which experience wide and frequent fluctuations in Na$^+$ concentration. Until recently, the range of functions that NCKX proteins play was generally underappreciated. This situation is now changing rapidly as evidence emerges for roles including photoreceptor adaptation, synaptic plasticity and skin pigmentation. The CCX (Ca$^{2+}$/cation exchanger) branch has only one mammalian member, NCKX6 or NCLX (Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$-Li+ exchanger), whose physiological function remains unclear, despite a broad pattern of expression.},

abstract = {Evidence has accumulated that classic L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel blockers with a dihydropyridine structure also inhibit T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels in certain types of central and peripheral neurons and in smooth muscle cells, albeit with a lower potency. Thus beneficial therapeutic effects of dihydropyridines in cardiovascular and neurological diseases may not only be associated with L-type but also with T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel blockade. Little is known about the exact order of potency of dihydropyridine derivatives at T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels. Here we investigate the efficacy and potency of four therapeutically used compounds, i.e. nifedipine, nimodipine, nicardipine, niguldipine, in the neuroblastoma-glioma cell line NG108-15. For comparative purposes the Ca$^{2+}$ channel agonist Bay K 8644 was included. Ca$^{2+}$ channel currents were measured with the whole-cell voltage clamp technique. Subtype Ca$^{2+}$ channel currents were separated by clamp protocol and selective blockers. T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel currents were inhibited with decreasing potency in the order niguldipine > nicardipine > nimodipine > nifedipine (IC50-values 244 nM, 2.5 microM, 9.8 microM, 39 microM), whereas L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel currents were blocked with similar potency (IC50 for nicardipine 75 nM). Bay K 8644 increased T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel current at nanomolar concentrations (i.e. 95 +/- 16\% increase by 300 nM). T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel block was completely reversible with exception of the block by niguldipine. Our results indicate a variability of two orders of magnitude in potency of T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel block by the dihydropyridine derivatives investigated. It is speculated that the relation between the L- and T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel block may determine the therapeutic profile of a dihydropyridine derivative.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter is the primary influx pathway for Ca$^{2+}$ into respiring mitochondria, and hence plays a key role in mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis. Though the mechanism of extra-matrix Ca$^{2+}$ dependency of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake has been well characterized both experimentally and mathematically, the mechanism of membrane potential ($\Delta$$\Psi$) dependency of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake has not been completely characterized. In this paper, we perform a quantitative reevaluation of a previous biophysical model of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter that characterized the possible mechanism of $\Delta$$\Psi$ dependency of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. Based on a model simulation analysis, we show that model predictions with a variant assumption (Case 2: external and internal Ca$^{2+}$ binding constants for the uniporter are distinct), that provides the best possible description of the $\Delta$$\Psi$ dependency, are highly sensitive to variation in matrix [Ca$^{2+}$], indicating limitations in the variant assumption (Case 2) in providing physiologically plausible description of the observed $\Delta$$\Psi$ dependency. This sensitivity is attributed to negative estimate of a biophysical parameter that characterizes binding of internal Ca$^{2+}$ to the uniporter. Reparameterization of the model with additional nonnengativity constraints on the biophysical parameters showed that the two variant assumptions (Case 1 and Case 2) are indistinguishable, indicating that the external and internal Ca$^{2+}$ binding constants for the uniporter may be equal (Case 1). The model predictions in this case are insensitive to variation in matrix [Ca$^{2+}$] but do not match the $\Delta$$\Psi$ dependent data in the domain $\Delta$$\Psi$≤120 mV. To effectively characterize this $\Delta$$\Psi$ dependency, we reformulate the $\Delta$$\Psi$ dependencies of the rate constants of Ca$^{2+}$ translocation via the uniporter by exclusively redefining the biophysical parameters associated with the free-energy barrier of Ca$^{2+}$ translocation based on a generalized, non-linear Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz formulation. This alternate uniporter model has all the characteristics of the previous uniporter model and is also able to characterize the possible mechanisms of both the extra-matrix Ca$^{2+}$ and $\Delta$$\Psi$ dependencies of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. In addition, the model is insensitive to variation in matrix [Ca$^{2+}$], predicting relatively stable physiological operation. The model is critical in developing mechanistic, integrated models of mitochondrial bioenergetics and Ca$^{2+}$ handling.},

In support of this view, a large body of experimental evidence has unambiguously revealed that, in addition to the well-established function of producing most of the cellular ATP, mitochondria play a fundamental role in triggering apoptotic cell death. Various apoptotic stimuli cause the release of specific mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors into the cytosol. The molecular mechanism of this release is still controversial, but there is no doubt that mitochondrial calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) overload is one of the pro-apoptotic ways to induce the swelling of mitochondria, with perturbation or rupture of the outer membrane, and in turn the release of mitochondrial apoptotic factors into the cytosol. Here, we review as different proteins that participate in mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis and in turn modulate the effectiveness of Ca$^{2+}$-dependent apoptotic stimuli. Strikingly, the final outcome at the cellular level is similar, albeit through completely different molecular mechanisms: a reduced mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ overload upon pro-apoptotic stimuli that dramatically blunts the apoptotic response.},

abstract = {Although targeting oncogenic mutations in the BRAF serine/threonine kinase with small molecule inhibitors can lead to significant clinical responses in melanoma, it fails to eradicate tumors in nearly all patients. Successful therapy will be aided by identification of intrinsic mechanisms that protect tumor cells from death. Here, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify drug-able, "driver" oncogenes restricted to tumor versus normal tissues. Applying this method to 88 short-term melanoma cell cultures, we show that the antiapoptotic BCL2 family member BCL2A1 is recurrently amplified in ∼30\% of melanomas and is necessary for melanoma growth. BCL2A1 overexpression also promotes melanomagenesis of BRAF-immortalized melanocytes. We find that high-level expression of BCL2A1 is restricted to melanoma due to direct transcriptional control by the melanoma oncogene MITF. Although BRAF inhibitors lead to cell cycle arrest and modest apoptosis, we find that apoptosis is significantly enhanced by suppression of BCL2A1 in melanomas with BCL2A1 or MITF amplification. Moreover, we find that BCL2A1 expression is associated with poorer clinical responses to BRAF pathway inhibitors in melanoma patients. Cotreatment of melanomas with BRAF inhibitors and obatoclax, an inhibitor of BCL2A1 and other BCL2 family members, overcomes intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors in BCL2A1-amplified cells in vitro and in vivo. These studies identify MITF-BCL2A1 as a lineage-specific oncogenic pathway in melanoma and underscore its role for improved response to BRAF-directed therapy.},

abstract = {The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a voltage-gated channel from the mitochondrial outer membrane. It has two gating processes: one at positive potentials and the other at negative potentials. The energetics of VDAC gating are quite different when measured in the presence or absence of an ion gradient. A positive potential on the high-salt side results in channel closure at lower transmembrane potentials. The midpoint potential (V0) shifted from 25 to 5.7 mV, with an activity gradient for KCl of 0.6 versus 0.06. The opposite occurred for negative potentials on the high-salt side (V0 shifted from -25 to -29 mV). Thus the salt gradient favored closure for one gating process and opening for the other. These results could be explained if part of the electrochemical potential of the gradients present were transferred to the gating mechanism. If the kinetic energy of the ion flow were coupled to the gating process, the effects of the gradient would depend on the mass and velocities of these ions. This was tested by using a series of different salts (KCl, NaCl, LiCl, KBr, K acetate, Na butyrate, and RbBr) under an identical activity gradient. The kinetic energy correlated very well with the measured shifts in free energy of the channel gating. This was true for both polarities. Thus the gating of VDAC is influenced by ion flow. These results are consistent in sign and direction with the voltage gating process in VDAC, which is believed to involve the movement of a positively charged portion of the wall of the channel out of the membrane.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the immunohistochemical characteristics of two kinds of human cutaneous sensory nerve formations (SNFs), the Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles. In both kinds of SNF the central axon might be easily identifiable because it displays immunoreactivity (IR) for the neuroendocrine markers neuron-specific enolase and protein gene product 9.5, as well as for neuron-specific intermediate filament proteins, i.e., neurofilaments. Other intermediate filament proteins such as vimentin are localized in the lamellar cells of Meissner corpuscles, and in the inner core, outer core and capsule of Pacinian corpuscles. However, they lack cytokeratins or glial fibrillary acidic protein IR. On the other hand, and in agreement with ultrastructural data, IR for basement membrane constituents laminin and type IV collagen is found underlying all SNF constituents, with the exception of the axon. One of the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of intracellular calcium ions (Ca$^{2+}$) homeostasis is the calcium binding proteins. Ca$^{2+}$ play a key role in the mechanoelectric transduction and have been localized in SNFs. In this way IR for the Ca$^{2+}$-binding proteins calbindin D28K, parvalbumin and calretinin, is present and colocalized in both Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles; furthermore, S-100 protein is exclusively localized in the lamellar cells and the inner core. On the other hand, the skin is a main source of neurotrophins for a subset of neural crest sensory neurons, some of which end forming SNF. These factors are conveyed via retrograde axonal transport from the skin to the cell body of the responsive neurons. Interestingly, Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles also display IR for the pan-neurotrophin low-affinity receptor (p75), and for the trkA receptor protein, a basic constituent of the high-affinity receptor for some neurotrophins. Moreover, they express IR for the epidermal growth factor receptor. Finally, other antigens not proper to the cells forming human cutaneous SNF, such as the epithelial membrane antigen and the leucocytary antigen-7, have also been detected.},

abstract = {BFL-1 is the smallest member of the BCL-2 family and has been shown to retard apoptosis in various cell lines. However, the structural basis for its function remains unclear. Molecular modeling showed that BFL-1 could have a similar core structure as BCL-xL, consisting of seven alpha helices, although both proteins share only the conserved BCL-2 homology domains (BH1 and BH2 domains), but otherwise have very limited sequence homology, particularly in the N-terminal region. We demonstrated in the yeast two-hybrid system that BFL-1 interacts strongly with human BAX but is not able to form homodimers nor to interact with human BCL-2 or BCL-xL. Overexpression experiments in REF52 rat fibroblasts showed that BFL-1 conferred increased resistance to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. BFL-1 had also the ability to neutralize BAX lethality in yeast. BAX requires the BH3 domain for interaction with BFL-1. However, the minimal region of BFL-1 for the interaction with BAX in coimmunoprecipitation experiments was not sufficient to protect cells from apoptosis. Further examination of BFL-1 and several other anti-apoptotic proteins suggests a more general type of structure based on structural motifs, i.e. a hydrophobic pocket for the binding of proapoptotic proteins, rather than extended sequence homologies.},

Retrospectively, more attention has been focused on the plasma membrane-associated interactions of these molecules and resulting cytoplasmic target activation. The complex biological activities exerted by Akt activation suggest, however, that more subtle and complex subcellular control mechanisms are involved. This review examines the regulation of Akt activity from the perspective of subcellular compartmentalization and focuses specifically upon the actions of Akt activation downstream from phosphoinositide synthesis that influence cell biology by altering nuclear signalling leading to Pim-1 kinase induction as well as hexokinase phosphorylation that, together with Akt, serves to preserve mitochondrial integrity.},

abstract = {In recent years, it has been recognized that there is a metabolic coupling between the cytosol, ER/SR and mitochondria. In this cross-talk, mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis and ATP production and supply play a major role. The primary transporter of adenine nucleotides, Ca$^{2+}$and other metabolites into and out of mitochondria is the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) located at the outer mitochondrial membrane, at a crucial position in the cell. VDAC has been established as a key player in mitochondrial metabolite and ion signaling and it has also been proposed that VDAC is present in extramitochondrial membranes. Thus, regulation of VDAC, as the main interface between mitochondrial and cellular metabolism, by other molecules is of utmost importance. This article reviews localization and function of VDAC, and focuses on VDAC as a skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum channel. The regulation of VDAC activity by associated proteins and by inhibitors is also presented. Several aspects of the physiological relevance of VDAC to Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis will be discussed.},

abstract = {Generation of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals in response to Ca$^{2+}$-mobilizing stimuli is a critical event in the control of many cellular processes. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) represents a dominant second messenger subserving the release of Ca$^{2+}$ from intracellular store sites. The protein on the surface of which the IP3 receptor is located comprises an IP3-gated Ca$^{2+}$ channel, and binding of IP3 to this receptor triggers the release of Ca$^{2+}$ through this channel. The receptor for IP3 displays a close resemblance to the ryanodine receptor, another intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ channel, in many molecular and physiological properties. Many lines of evidence strongly suggest the central role that the IP3 receptor plays in the conversion of numerous external stimuli to intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals characterized by complex spatiotemporal patterns such as Ca$^{2+}$ waves and oscillations. In this review, we shall summarize our current knowledge of the structure and function of the IP3 receptor in order to understand the way how the activity of this important receptor is regulated to accomodate itself to the generation of diverse intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals.},

abstract = {We use here a new very low-Ca$^{2+}$-affinity targeted aequorin to measure the [Ca$^{2+}$] in the endoplasmic reticulum ([Ca$^{2+}$]ER). The new aequorin chimera has the right Ca$^{2+}$-affinity to make long-lasting measurements of [Ca$^{2+}$]ER in the millimolar range. Moreover, previous Ca$^{2+}$-depletion of the ER is no longer required. The steady-state [Ca$^{2+}$]ER obtained is 1-2 mM, higher than previously reported. In addition, we find evidence that there is significant heterogeneity in [Ca$^{2+}$]ER among different regions of the ER. About half of the ER had a [Ca$^{2+}$]ER of 1 mM or below, and the rest had [Ca$^{2+}$]ER values above 1mM and in some parts even above 2 mM. About 5\% of the ER was also found to have high [Ca$^{2+}$]ER levels but to be thapsigargin-insensitive and inositol trisphosphate insensitive. The rate of refilling with Ca$^{2+}$ of the ER was almost linearly dependent on the extracellular [Ca$^{2+}$] between 0.1 and 3 mM, and was only partially affected by mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Instead, it was significantly reduced by loading cells with chelators, and the fast chelator BAPTA was much more effective than the slow chelator EGTA. This suggests that local [Ca$^{2+}$] microdomains connecting the store operated Ca$^{2+}$ channels with the ER Ca$^{2+}$ pumps may be important during refilling.},

abstract = {It is well-established that subcompartments of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are in physical contact with the mitochondria. These lipid raft-like regions of ER are referred to as mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), and they play an important role in, for example, lipid synthesis, calcium homeostasis, and apoptotic signaling. Perturbation of MAM function has previously been suggested in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as shown in fibroblasts from AD patients and a neuroblastoma cell line containing familial presenilin-2 AD mutation. The effect of AD pathogenesis on the ER-mitochondria interplay in the brain has so far remained unknown. Here, we studied ER-mitochondria contacts in human AD brain and related AD mouse and neuronal cell models. We found uniform distribution of MAM in neurons. Phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein-2 and $\sigma$1 receptor, two MAM-associated proteins, were shown to be essential for neuronal survival, because siRNA knockdown resulted in degeneration. Up-regulated MAM-associated proteins were found in the AD brain and amyloid precursor protein (APP)Swe/Lon mouse model, in which up-regulation was observed before the appearance of plaques. By studying an ER-mitochondria bridging complex, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor-voltage-dependent anion channel, we revealed that nanomolar concentrations of amyloid $\beta$-peptide increased inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and voltage-dependent anion channel protein expression and elevated the number of ER-mitochondria contact points and mitochondrial calcium concentrations. Our data suggest an important role of ER-mitochondria contacts and cross-talk in AD pathology.},

@article{Raturi2013,
abstract = {More than a billion years ago, bacterial precursors of mitochondria became endosymbionts in what we call eukaryotic cells today. The true significance of the word "endosymbiont" has only become clear to cell biologists with the discovery that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) superorganelle dedicates a special domain for the metabolic interaction with mitochondria. This domain, identified in all eukaryotic cell systems from yeast to man and called the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), has a distinct proteome, specific tethers on the cytosolic face and regulatory proteins in the ER lumen of the ER. The MAM has distinct biochemical properties and appears as ER tubules closely apposed to mitochondria on electron micrographs. The functions of the MAM range from lipid metabolism and calcium signaling to inflammasome formation. Consistent with these functions, the MAM is enriched in lipid metabolism enzymes and calcium handling proteins. During cellular stress situations, like an altered cellular redox state, the MAM alters its set of regulatory proteins and thus alters MAM functions. Notably, this set prominently comprises ER chaperones and oxidoreductases that connect protein synthesis and folding inside the ER to mitochondrial metabolism. Moreover, ER membranes associated with mitochondria also accommodate parts of the machinery that determines mitochondrial membrane dynamics and connect mitochondria to the cytoskeleton. Together, these exciting findings demonstrate that the physiological interactions between the ER and mitochondria are so bilateral that we are tempted to compare their relationship to the one of a married couple: distinct, but inseparable and certainly dependent on each other. In this paradigm, the MAM stands for the intracellular location where the two organelles tie the knot. Resembling "real life", the happy marriage between the two organelles prevents the onset of diseases that are characterized by disrupted metabolism and decreased lifespan, including neurodegeneration and cancer. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondrial dynamics and physiology.},

abstract = {A mechanism of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake, capable of sequestering significant amounts of Ca$^{2+}$ from cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ pulses, has previously been identified in liver mitochondria. This mechanism, the Rapid Mode of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake (RaM), was shown to sequester Ca$^{2+}$ very rapidly at the beginning of each pulse in a sequence [Sparagna et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 27510-27515]. The existence and properties of RaM in heart mitochondria, however, are unknown and are the basis for this study. We show that RaM functions in heart mitochondria with some of the characteristics of RaM in liver, but its activation and inhibition are quite different. It is feasible that these differences represent different physiological adaptations in these two tissues. In both tissues, RaM is highly conductive at the beginning of a Ca$^{2+}$ pulse, but is inhibited by the rising [Ca$^{2+}$] of the pulse itself. In heart mitochondria, the time required at low [Ca$^{2+}$] to reestablish high Ca$^{2+}$ conductivity via RaM i.e. the 'resetting time' of RaM is much longer than in liver. RaM in liver mitochondria is strongly activated by spermine, activated by ATP or GTP and unaffected by ADP and AMP. In heart, RaM is activated much less strongly by spermine and unaffected by ATP or GTP. RaM in heart is strongly inhibited by AMP and has a biphasic response to ADP; it is activated at low concentrations and inhibited at high concentrations. Finally, an hypothesis consistent with the data and characteristics of liver and heart is presented to explain how RaM may function to control the rate of oxidative phosphorylation in each tissue. Under this hypothesis, RaM functions to create a brief, high free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration inside mitochondria which may activate intramitochondrial metabolic reactions with relatively small amounts of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. This hypothesis is consistent with the view that intramitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] may be used to control the rate of ADP phosphorylation in such a way as to minimize the probability of activating the Ca$^{2+}$-induced mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT).},

abstract = {The heterogenous subcellular distribution of a wide array of channels, pumps and exchangers allows extracellular stimuli to induce increases in cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]c) with highly defined spatial and temporal patterns, that in turn induce specific cellular responses (e.g. contraction, secretion, proliferation or cell death). In this extreme complexity, the role of mitochondria was considered marginal, till the direct measurement with targeted indicators allowed to appreciate that rapid and large increases of the [Ca$^{2+}$] in the mitochondrial matrix ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) invariably follow the cytosolic rises. Given the low affinity of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transporters, the close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca$^{2+}$-releasing channels was shown to be responsible for the prompt responsiveness of mitochondria. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of: i) the mitochondrial and ER Ca$^{2+}$ channels mediating the ion transfer, ii) the structural and molecular foundations of the signaling contacts between the two organelles, iii) the functional consequences of the [Ca$^{2+}$]m increases, and iv) the effects of oncogene-mediated signals on mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis. Despite the rapid progress carried out in the latest years, a deeper molecular understanding is still needed to unlock the secrets of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling machinery.},

abstract = {Calcium depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces oligomerisation, puncta formation and translocation of the ER Ca$^{2+}$ sensor proteins, STIM1 and -2 into plasma membrane (PM)-adjacent regions of the ER, where they activate the Orai1, -2 or -3 proteins present in the opposing PM. These proteins form ion channels through which store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ influx (SOC) occurs. Calcium ions exert negative feed-back on SOC. Here we examined whether subplasmalemmal mitochondria, which reduce this feed-back by Ca$^{2+}$ uptake, are located within or out of the high-Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains (HCMDs) formed between the ER and plasmalemmal Orai1 channels. For this purpose, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with Orai1, STIM1 labelled with YFP or mRFP and the mitochondrially targeted Ca$^{2+}$ sensitive fluorescent protein inverse-Pericam. Depletion of ER Ca$^{2+}$ with ATP+thapsigargin (in Ca$^{2+}$-free medium) induced the appearance of STIM1 puncta in the < or =100 nm wide subplasmalemmal space, as examined with TIRF. Mitochondria were located either in the gaps between STIM1-tagged puncta or in remote, STIM1-free regions. After addition of Ca$^{2+}$ mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentration increased irrespective of the mitochondrion-STIM1 distance. These observations indicate that mitochondria are exposed to Ca$^{2+}$ diffused laterally from the HCMDs formed between the PM and the subplasmalemmal ER.},

abstract = {Calcium ions are ubiquitous and versatile signaling molecules, capable of decoding a variety of extracellular stimuli (hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, etc.) into markedly different intracellular actions, ranging from contraction to secretion, from proliferation to cell death. The key to this pleiotropic role is the complex spatiotemporal organization of the [Ca$^{2+}$] rise evoked by extracellular agonists, which allows selected effectors to be recruited and specific actions to be initiated. In this review, we discuss the structural and functional bases that generate the subcellular heterogeneity in cellular Ca$^{2+}$ levels at rest and under stimulation. This complex choreography requires the concerted action of many different players; the central role is, of course, that of the calcium ion, with the main supporting characters being all the entities responsible for moving Ca$^{2+}$ between different compartments, while the cellular architecture provides a determining framework within which all the players have their exits and their entrances. In particular, we concentrate on the molecular mechanisms that lead to the generation of cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains, focusing on their different subcellular location, mechanism of generation, and functional role.},

abstract = {VDAC is the major permeability pathway in the mitochondrial outer membrane and can control the flow of metabolites and ions. Therefore Ca$^{2+}$ flux across the outer membrane occurs mainly through VDAC. Since both Ca$^{2+}$ fluxes and VDAC are involved in apoptosis, we examined whether Ca$^{2+}$ is required for channel formation by VDAC isolated from rat liver. The voltage gating of VDAC does not require Ca$^{2+}$ and it functions normally with or without Ca$^{2+}$. Additionally, VDAC generally shows a higher permeability to Ca$^{2+}$ in the closed states (states with lower permeability to metabolites) than that in the open state. Thus VDAC closure, which induces apoptosis, also favors Ca$^{2+}$ flux into mitochondria, which can also lead to permeability transition and cell death. These results are consistent with the view that VDAC closure is a pro-apoptotic signal.},

abstract = {The modulation of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling patterns during repetitive stimulations represents an important mechanism for integrating through time the inputs received by a cell. By either overexpressing the isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) or inhibiting them with specific blockers, we investigated the role of this family of proteins in regulating the dynamic interplay of the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ pools. The effects of the different isoforms spanned from the reduction of ER Ca$^{2+}$ release (PKCalpha) to the increase or reduction of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake (PKCzeta and PKCbeta/PKCdelta, respectively). This PKC-dependent regulatory mechanism underlies the process of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ desensitization, which in turn modulates cellular responses (e.g., insulin secretion). These results demonstrate that organelle Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis (and in particular mitochondrial processing of Ca$^{2+}$ signals) is tuned through the wide molecular repertoire of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ transducers.},

abstract = {Regulation of mitochondrial physiology requires an efficient exchange of molecules between mitochondria and the cytoplasm via the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) lies in the OMM and forms a common pathway for the exchange of metabolites between the mitochondria and the cytosol, thus playing a crucial role in the regulation of metabolic and energetic functions of mitochondria. VDAC is also recognized to function in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and in apoptosis regulation via interaction with anti-apoptotic proteins, namely members of Bcl-2 family, and the pro-survival protein, hexokinase, overexpressed in many cancer types. Thus, VDAC appears to be a convergence point for a variety of cell survival and cell death signals, mediated by its association with various ligands and proteins. In this article, we review mammalian VDAC, specifically focusing on VDAC1, addressing its functions in cell life and the regulation of apoptosis and its involvement in several diseases. Additionally, we provide insight into the potential of VDAC1 as a rational target for novel therapeutics.},

abstract = {Activation and oligomerisation of Bax, a key pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, are key steps in the mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis. The signals for apoptosis are conveyed by the distantly related BH3-only proteins, which use their short BH3 domain, an amphipathic $\alpha$-helix, to interact with other Bcl-2 family members. Here we report an NMR study of interactions between Bax$\Delta$C and BH3 domain-containing peptides in the absence and presence of CHAPS, a zwitterionic detergent. We find for the first time that CHAPS interacts weakly with Bax$\Delta$C (fast exchange on the NMR chemical shift timescale), at concentrations below micelle formation and with an estimated Kd in the tens of mM. Direct and relatively strong-interactions (slow exchange on the NMR chemical shift timescale) were also observed for Bax$\Delta$C with BaxBH3 (estimated Kd of circa 150$\mu$M) or BimBH3 in the absence of CHAPS. The interaction with either peptide alone induced widespread chemical shift perturbations to Bax$\Delta$C in solution which implies that Bax$\Delta$C might have undergone significant conformation change upon binding the BH3 peptide. However, Bax$\Delta$C remained monomeric upon binding either CHAPS or a BH3 peptide alone, but the presence of both provoked it to form a dimer.},

abstract = {In the presence of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (InsP3) repetitive waves of elevated cytosolic free Ca$^{2+}$ (Ca waves) that travel through cellular cytoplasm are observed. Investigation of this phenomenon stimulated the view of cellular cytoplasm as 'an excitable medium composed of Ca release processes (InsP3R), coupled by a common stimulatory signal (Ca) through diffusion' [Lechleiter JD. Clapham DE. (1992) Molecular mechanisms of intracellular calcium excitability in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Cell, 69, 283-294]. Using a kinetic model of InsP3R gating, an analytical expression for the amplitude of Ca wave propagating through this excitable medium has been obtained. The amplitude of the Ca wave is determined by the combination of cell-specific parameters and the functional properties of a single InsP3R. An analytical expression for Ca wave propagation velocity has been also obtained using the Luther equation for diffusion-driven autocatalytic reaction. Both equations provided reasonable estimations for Ca wave amplitude (1.3 microM free Ca) and the velocity of the wave propagation (21 microns/s) for Ca waves in Xenopus oocytes when numerical values of parameters were used. The duration of refractory period has been shown to be determined mainly by the activity of CaATPase. Obtained results provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying the process of Ca wave propagation and define the interrelationship between different factors involved in this process. Some experimentally testable predictions can be done based on the analytical expressions obtained for Ca wave amplitude, the velocity of Ca wave propagation and the duration of refractory period.},

On the contrary, evidence has been accumulating that it may be the common outcome of several distinct processes, involving different proteins or protein complexes, depending on circumstances. A clear definition of this putative variety is a prerequisite for an understanding of mitochondrial permeabilization within cells, of its roles in the life of organisms, and of the possibilities for pharmacological intervention.},

abstract = {Atrial cardiomyocytes make an important contribution to the refilling of ventricles with blood, which enhances the subsequent ejection of blood from the heart. The dependence of cardiac function on the contribution of atria becomes increasingly important with age and exercise. We know much less about the calcium signals that link electrical depolarisation to contraction within atrial myocytes in comparison with ventricular myocytes. Nevertheless, recent work has shed new light on calcium signalling in atrial cells. At an ultrastructural level, atrial and ventricular myocytes have many similarities. However, a few key structural differences, in particular the lack of transverse tubules (;T-tubules') in atrial myocytes, make these two cell types display vastly different calcium patterns in response to depolarisation. The lack of T-tubules in atrial myocytes means that depolarisation provokes calcium signals that largely originate around the periphery of the cells. To engage the contractile machinery, the calcium signal must propagate centripetally deeper into the cells. This inward movement of calcium is ultimately controlled by hormones that can promote or decrease calcium release within the myocytes. Enhanced centripetal movement of calcium in atrial myocytes leads to increased contraction and a more substantial contribution to blood pumping. The calcium signalling paradigm within atrial cells applies to other cardiac cell types that also do not express T-tubules, such as neonatal ventricular myocytes, and Purkinje cells that aid in the spread of electrical depolarisation. Furthermore, during heart failure ventricular myocytes progressively lose their regular T-tubule expression, and their pattern of response resembles that of atrial cells.},

However, it is inherently difficult to distinguish experimentally between the contributions of messenger-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release and CICR. We have directly tested the CICR sensitivity of different regions of intact pancreatic acinar cells using local uncaging of caged Ca$^{2+}$. In the apical region, local uncaging of Ca$^{2+}$ was able to trigger a CICR wave, which propagated toward the base. CICR could not be triggered in the basal region, despite the known presence of ryanodine receptors. The triggering of CICR from the apical region was inhibited by a pharmacological block of ryanodine or inositol trisphosphate receptors, indicating that global signals require coordinated Ca$^{2+}$ release. Subthreshold agonist stimulation increased the probability of triggering CICR by apical uncaging, and uncaging-induced CICR could activate long-lasting Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. However, with subthreshold stimulation, CICR could still not be initiated in the basal region. CICR is the major process responsible for global Ca$^{2+}$ transients, and intracellular variations in sensitivity to CICR predetermine the activation pattern of Ca$^{2+}$ waves.},

Removal of Ca$^{2+}$ from mitochondria permits rapid and efficient changes in the rate of ATP production to adapt to changing demands and can reverse the process of PT induction. Two separate, saturable mechanisms for facilitating Ca$^{2+}$ efflux from mitochondria exist.

Here we briefly review what is known about these important mitochondrial mechanisms and from their behavior speculate on their possible and probable functions.},

abstract = {Mitochondria are not only important for the energetic status of the cell, but are also the fatal organelles deciding about cellular life and death. Complex mitochondrial features decisive for cell death execution in mammals are present and functional in yeast: AIF and cytochrome c release to the cytosol, mitochondrial fragmentation as well as mitochondrial hyperpolarisation followed by an oxidative burst, and breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential. The easy accessibility of mitochondrial manipulations such as repression of respiration by growing yeast on glucose or deletion of mitochondrial DNA (rho(0)) on the one hand and the unique ability of yeast cells to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources by switching on mitochondrial respiration on the other hand have made yeast an excellent tool to delineate the necessity for mitochondria in cell death execution. Yeast research indicates that the connection between mitochondria and apoptosis is intricate, as abrogation of mitochondrial function can be either deleterious or beneficial for the cell depending on the specific context of the death scenario. Surprisingly, mitochondrion dependent yeast apoptosis currently helps to understand the aetiology (or the complex biology) of lethal cytoskeletal alterations, ageing and neurodegeneration. For example, mutation of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase or CDC48/VCP mutations, both implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders, are associated with mitochondrial impairment and apoptosis in yeast.},

Because of their inherent nonlinear nature and the consequent unreliability of intuitive approaches, mathematical modeling has an important role to play in the study of these phenomena. One important class of oscillations and waves is dependent on the presence of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3), which releases Ca$^{2+}$ from internal stores via the IP3 receptor/Ca$^{2+}$ channel. With the minimum possible mathematical formalism, we review mechanistic models for IP3-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations and waves. These models are based on the regulation of the IP3 receptor by both IP3 and Ca$^{2+}$, and incorporate experimental data on the steady-state and kinetic properties of the receptor. The extension of the models to describe intracellular and intercellular Ca$^{2+}$ waves is considered.},

abstract = {Irrespective of the morphological features of end-stage cell death (that may be apoptotic, necrotic, autophagic, or mitotic), mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) is frequently the decisive event that delimits the frontier between survival and death. Thus mitochondrial membranes constitute the battleground on which opposing signals combat to seal the cell's fate. Local players that determine the propensity to MMP include the pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, proteins from the mitochondrialpermeability transition pore complex, as well as a plethora of interacting partners including mitochondrial lipids. Intermediate metabolites, redox processes, sphingolipids, ion gradients, transcription factors, as well as kinases and phosphatases link lethal and vital signals emanating from distinct subcellular compartments to mitochondria. Thus mitochondria integrate a variety of proapoptotic signals. Once MMP has been induced, it causes the release of catabolic hydrolases and activators of such enzymes (including those of caspases) from mitochondria. These catabolic enzymes as well as the cessation of the bioenergetic and redox functions of mitochondria finally lead to cell death, meaning that mitochondria coordinate the late stage of cellular demise. Pathological cell death induced by ischemia/reperfusion, intoxication with xenobiotics, neurodegenerative diseases, or viral infection also relies on MMP as a critical event. The inhibition of MMP constitutes an important strategy for the pharmaceutical prevention of unwarranted cell death. Conversely, induction of MMP in tumor cells constitutes the goal of anticancer chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels was studied in inner hair cells (IHCs) in an ex vivo preparation of the apical turn of the rat organ of Corti. Whole cell voltage clamp in the presence of potassium channel blockers showed inward calcium currents with millisecond activation and deactivation kinetics. When temperature was raised from 22 to 37 degrees C, the calcium currents of immature IHCs [<12 days postnatal (P12)] increased threefold in amplitude, and developed more pronounced inactivation. This was determined to be calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) on the basis of its reliance on external calcium (substitution with barium), sensitivity to internal calcium-buffering, and voltage dependence (reflecting the calcium driving force). After the onset of hearing at P12, IHC calcium current amplitude and the extent of inactivation were greatly reduced. Although smaller than in prehearing IHCs, CDI remained significant in the mature IHC near the resting membrane potential. CDI in mature IHCs was enhanced by application of the endoplasmic calcium pump blocker, benzo-hydroquinone. Conversely, CDI in immature IHCs was reduced by calmodulin inhibitors. Thus voltage-gated calcium channels in mammalian IHCs are subject to a calmodulin-mediated process of CDI. The extent of CDI depends on the balance of calcium buffering mechanisms and may be regulated by calmodulin-specific processes. CDI provides a means for the rate of spontaneous transmitter release to be adjusted to variations in hair cell resting potential and steady state calcium influx.},

Autocrine motility factor receptor (AMF-R) is a marker for a smooth subdomain of the ER, shown here by confocal microscopy to be distinct from, yet closely associated with the calnexin- or calreticulin-labeled ER. By EM, smooth ER AMF-R tubules exhibit direct interactions with mitochondria, identifying them as a mitochondria-associated smooth ER subdomain. In digitonin-permeabilized MDCK cells, the addition of rat liver cytosol stimulates the dissociation of smooth ER and mitochondria under conditions of low calcium. Using BAPTA chelators of various affinities and CaEGTA buffers of defined free Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations and quantitative confocal microscopy, we show that free calcium concentrations <100 nM favor dissociation, whereas those >1 microM favor close association between these two organelles. Therefore, we describe a cellular mechanism that facilitates the close association of this smooth ER subdomain and mitochondria when cytosolic free calcium rises above physiological levels.},

abstract = {The C2 domain is a Ca$^{2+}$-binding motif of approximately 130 residues in length originally identified in the Ca$^{2+}$-dependent isoforms of protein kinase C. Single and multiple copies of C2 domains have been identified in a growing number of eukaryotic signalling proteins that interact with cellular membranes and mediate a broad array of critical intracellular processes, including membrane trafficking, the generation of lipid-second messengers, activation of GTPases, and the control of protein phosphorylation. As a group, C2 domains display the remarkable property of binding a variety of different ligands and substrates, including Ca$^{2+}$, phospholipids, inositol polyphosphates, and intracellular proteins. Expanding this functional diversity is the fact that not all proteins containing C2 domains are regulated by Ca$^{2+}$, suggesting that some C2 domains may play a purely structural role or may have lost the ability to bind Ca$^{2+}$. The present review summarizes the information currently available regarding the structure and function of the C2 domain and provides a novel sequence alignment of 65 C2 domain primary structures. This alignment predicts that C2 domains form two distinct topological folds, illustrated by the recent crystal structures of C2 domains from synaptotagmin 1 and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-delta 1, respectively. The alignment highlights residues that may be critical to the C2 domain fold or required for Ca$^{2+}$ binding and regulation.},

abstract = {Although the physiological relevance of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis is widely accepted, no information is yet available on the molecular identity of the proteins involved in this process. Here we analyzed the role of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) of the outer mitochondrial membrane in the transmission of Ca$^{2+}$ signals between the ER and mitochondria by measuring cytosolic and organelle [Ca$^{2+}$] with targeted aequorins and Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive GFPs. In HeLa cells and skeletal myotubes, the transient expression of VDAC enhanced the amplitude of the agonist-dependent increases in mitochondrial matrix Ca$^{2+}$ concentration by allowing the fast diffusion of Ca$^{2+}$ from ER release sites to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Indeed, high speed imaging of mitochondrial and cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] changes showed that the delay between the rises occurring in the two compartments is significantly shorter in VDAC-overexpressing cells. As to the functional consequences, VDAC-overexpressing cells are more susceptible to ceramide-induced cell death, thus confirming that mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake plays a key role in the process of apoptosis. These results reveal a novel function for the widely expressed VDAC channel, identifying it as a molecular component of the routes for Ca$^{2+}$ transport across the mitochondrial membranes.},

abstract = {We have investigated the kinetics of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ influx and efflux and their dependence on cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] and [Na(+)] using low-Ca$^{2+}$-affinity aequorin. The rate of Ca$^{2+}$ release from mitochondria increased linearly with mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$](M)). Na(+)-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ release was predominant al low [Ca$^{2+}$](M) but saturated at [Ca$^{2+}$](M) around 400muM, while Na(+)-independent Ca$^{2+}$ release was very slow at [Ca$^{2+}$](M) below 200muM, and then increased at higher [Ca$^{2+}$](M), perhaps through the opening of a new pathway. Half-maximal activation of Na(+)-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ release occurred at 5-10mM [Na(+)], within the physiological range of cytosolic [Na(+)]. Ca$^{2+}$ entry rates were comparable in size to Ca$^{2+}$ exit rates at cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$](c)) below 7muM, but the rate of uptake was dramatically accelerated at higher [Ca$^{2+}$](c). As a consequence, the presence of [Na(+)] considerably reduced the rate of [Ca$^{2+}$](M) increase at [Ca$^{2+}$](c) below 7muM, but its effect was hardly appreciable at 10muM [Ca$^{2+}$](c). Exit rates were more dependent on the temperature than uptake rates, thus making the [Ca$^{2+}$](M) transients to be much more prolonged at lower temperature. Our kinetic data suggest that mitochondria have little high affinity Ca$^{2+}$ buffering, and comparison of our results with data on total mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ fluxes indicate that the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ bound/Ca$^{2+}$ free ratio is around 10- to 100-fold for most of the observed [Ca$^{2+}$](M) range and suggest that massive phosphate precipitation can only occur when [Ca$^{2+}$](M) reaches the millimolar range.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that mitofusin 2 (Mfn-2) (or hyperplasia suppressor gene [HSG]) inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. Here, we demonstrate that Mfn-2 is a primary determinant of VSMC apoptosis. First, oxidative stress with H2O2, inhibition of protein kinase C with staurosporine, activation of protein kinase A with forskolin, and serum deprivation concurrently elevate Mfn-2 expression and induce VSMC apoptosis. Second, overexpression of Mfn-2 also triggers apoptosis of VSMCs in culture and in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries, thus contributing to Mfn-2-mediated prevention of neointima formation after angioplasty. Third, Mfn-2 silencing protects VSMCs against H2O2 or Mfn-2 overexpression-induced apoptosis, indicating that upregulation of Mfn-2 is necessary and sufficient for oxidative stress-mediated VSMC apoptosis. The Mfn-2 proapoptotic effect is independent of its role in mitochondrial fusion but mainly mediated by inhibition of Akt signaling and the resultant activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as manifested by decreased Akt phosphorylation, increased mitochondrial Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspases-9 and caspase-3. Furthermore, Mfn-2-induced apoptosis was blocked by overexpression of an active phosphoinositide 3-kinase mutant or Bcl-xL or inhibition of caspase-9 but not caspases-8. Thus, in addition to its antiproliferative effects, Mfn-2 constitutes a primary determinant of VSMC apoptosis.},

abstract = {We develop a simplified, but useful, mathematical model to describe Ca$^{2+}$ handling by mitochondria in the pancreatic beta-cell. The model includes the following six transport mechanisms in the inner mitochondrial membrane: proton pumping via respiration and proton uptake by way of the F1Fzero-ATPase (adapted from D. Pietrobon and S. Caplan. Biochemistry 24: 5764-5778, 1985), a proton leak, adenine nucleotide exchange, the Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter, and Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange. Each mechanism is developed separately into a kinetic model for the rate of transport, with parameters taken from experiments on isolated mitochondrial preparations. These mechanisms are combined in a modular fashion first to describe state 4 (nonphosphorylating) and state 3 (phosphorylating) mitochondria with mitochondrial NADH and Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations as fixed parameters and then to describe Ca$^{2+}$ handling with variable mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentration. Simulations are compared to experimental measurements and agree well with the threshold for Ca$^{2+}$ uptake, measured mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ levels, and the influence of Ca$^{2+}$ on oxygen uptake. In the absence of Ca$^{2+}$ activation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, the simulations predict a significant reduction in the rate of production of ATP that involves a "short circuit" via Ca$^{2+}$ uptake through the uniporter. This effect suggests a potential role for mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling in determining the ATP-ADP ratio in the pancreatic beta-cell.},

Functionally, VDAC is involved in the exchange of small metabolites over the mitochondrial outer membrane and supports enzymes of the cytoplasm with energy precursors i.e. ATP. Moreover, the channel alone or in complex with proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane or the intermembrane space provides a basis for docking of cytosolic proteins which can regulate outer membrane permeability in several ways. Structurally, this channel has a bacterial origin by evolution and partly resembles bacterial porin functions. However, the structure seems more complex as a variety of interactions on both channel sides can occur. Therefore, our work described is aiming to determine the structure of VDAC at atomic resolution and together with functional data to understand better how this channel can carry out such a variety of differing functions.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial activity is critical for efficient function of the cardiovascular system. In response to cardiovascular injury, mitochondrial dysfunction occurs and can lead to apoptosis and necrosis. Calpains are a 15-member family of Ca$^{2+}$-activated cysteine proteases localized to the cytosol and mitochondria, and several have been shown to regulate apoptosis and necrosis. For example, in endothelial cells, Ca$^{2+}$ overload causes mitochondrial calpain 1 cleavage of the Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger leading to mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation. Also, activated calpain 1 cleaves Bid, inducing cytochrome c release and apoptosis. In renal cells, calpains 1 and 2 promote apoptosis and necrosis by cleaving cytoskeletal proteins, which increases plasma membrane permeability and cleavage of caspases. Calpain 10 cleaves electron transport chain proteins, causing decreased mitochondrial respiration and excessive activation, or inhibition of calpain 10 activity induces mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. In cardiomyocytes, calpain 1 activates caspase 3 and poly-ADP ribose polymerase during tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$-induced apoptosis, and calpain 1 cleaves apoptosis-inducing factor after Ca$^{2+}$ overload. Many of these observations have been elucidated with calpain inhibitors, but most calpain inhibitors are not specific for calpains or a specific calpain family member, creating more questions. The following review will discuss how calpains affect mitochondrial function and apoptosis within the cardiovascular system.},

abstract = {Although it has been known for over three decades that mitochondria are endowed with a complex array of Ca$^{2+}$ transporters and that key enzymes of mitochondrial metabolism are regulated by Ca$^{2+}$, the possibility that physiological stimuli that raise the [Ca$^{2+}$] of the cytoplasm could trigger major mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake has long been considered unlikely, based on the low affinity of the mitochondrial transporters and the limited amplitude of the cytoplasmic [Ca$^{2+}$] rises. The direct measurement of mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] with highly selective probes has led to a complete reversion of this view, by demonstrating that, after cell stimulation, the cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ signal is always paralleled by a much larger rise in [Ca$^{2+}$] in the mitochondrial matrix. This observation has rejuvenated the study of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport and novel, unexpected results have altered long-standing dogmas in the field of calcium signalling. Here we focus on four main topics: (i) the current knowledge of the functional properties of the Ca$^{2+}$ transporters and of the thermodynamic constraints under which they operate; (ii) the occurrence of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake in living cells and the key role of local signalling routes between the mitochondria and the Ca$^{2+}$ sources; (iii) the physiological consequences of Ca$^{2+}$ transport for both mitochondrial function and the modulation of the cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ signal; and (iv) evidence that alterations of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ signalling may occur in pathophysiological conditions.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial calcium uptake is a critical event in various cellular activities. Two recently identified proteins, the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter (MCU), which is the pore-forming subunit of a Ca$^{2+}$ channel, and mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1), which is the regulator of MCU, are essential in this event. However, the molecular mechanism by which MICU1 regulates MCU remains elusive. In this study, we report the crystal structures of Ca$^{2+}$-free and Ca$^{2+}$-bound human MICU1. Our studies reveal that Ca$^{2+}$-free MICU1 forms a hexamer that binds and inhibits MCU. Upon Ca$^{2+}$ binding, MICU1 undergoes large conformational changes, resulting in the formation of multiple oligomers to activate MCU. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the affinity of MICU1 for Ca$^{2+}$ is approximately 15-20 $\mu$M. Collectively, our results provide valuable details to decipher the molecular mechanism of MICU1 regulation of mitochondrial calcium uptake.},

abstract = {Uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2/3) are essential for mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake but both proteins exhibit distinct activities in regard to the source and mode of Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization. In the present work, structural determinants of their contribution to mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake were explored. Previous findings indicate the importance of the intermembrane loop 2 (IML2) for the contribution of UCP2/3. Thus, the IML2 of UCP2/3 was substituted by that of UCP1. These chimeras had no activity in mitochondrial uptake of intracellularly released Ca$^{2+}$, while they mimicked the wild-type proteins by potentiating mitochondrial sequestration of entering Ca$^{2+}$. Alignment of the IML2 sequences revealed that UCP1, UCP2 and UCP3 share a basic amino acid in positions 163, 164 and 167, while only UCP2 and UCP3 contain a second basic residue in positions 168 and 171, respectively. Accordingly, mutants of UCP3 in positions 167 and 171/172 were made. In permeabilized cells, these mutants exhibited distinct Ca$^{2+}$ sensitivities in regard to mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ sequestration. In intact cells, these mutants established different activities in mitochondrial uptake of either intracellularly released (UCP3(R171,E172)) or entering (UCP3(R167)) Ca$^{2+}$. Our data demonstrate that distinct sites in the IML2 of UCP3 effect mitochondrial uptake of high and low Ca$^{2+}$ signals.},

abstract = {A variety of stimuli utilize an increase of cytosolic free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration as a second messenger to transmit signals, through Ca$^{2+}$ release from the endoplasmic reticulum or opening of plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$ channels. Mitochondria contribute to the tight spatiotemporal control of this process by accumulating Ca$^{2+}$, thus shaping the return of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ to resting levels. The rise of mitochondrial matrix free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration stimulates oxidative metabolism; yet, in the presence of a variety of sensitizing factors of pathophysiological relevance, the matrix Ca$^{2+}$ increase can also lead to opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP), a high conductance inner membrane channel. While transient openings may serve the purpose of providing a fast Ca$^{2+}$ release mechanism, persistent PTP opening is followed by deregulated release of matrix Ca$^{2+}$, termination of oxidative phosphorylation, matrix swelling with inner membrane unfolding and eventually outer membrane rupture with release of apoptogenic proteins and cell death. Thus, a rise in mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ can convey both apoptotic and necrotic death signals by inducing opening of the PTP. Understanding the signalling networks that govern changes in mitochondrial free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration, their interplay with Ca$^{2+}$ signalling in other subcellular compartments, and regulation of PTP has important implications in the fine comprehension of the main biological routines of the cell and in disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {We introduce a new method for mesoscopic modeling of protein diffusion in an entire cell. This method is based on the construction of a three-dimensional digital model cell from confocal microscopy data. The model cell is segmented into the cytoplasm, nucleus, plasma membrane, and nuclear envelope, in which environment protein motion is modeled by fully numerical mesoscopic methods. Finer cellular structures that cannot be resolved with the imaging technique, which significantly affect protein motion, are accounted for in this method by assigning an effective, position-dependent porosity to the cell. This porosity can also be determined by confocal microscopy using the equilibrium distribution of a non-binding fluorescent protein. Distinction can now be made within this method between diffusion in the liquid phase of the cell (cytosol/nucleosol) and the cytoplasm/nucleoplasm. Here we applied the method to analyze fluorescence recovery after photobleach (FRAP) experiments in which the diffusion coefficient of a freely-diffusing model protein was determined for two different cell lines, and to explain the clear difference typically observed between conventional FRAP results and those of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). A large difference was found in the FRAP experiments between diffusion in the cytoplasm/nucleoplasm and in the cytosol/nucleosol, for all of which the diffusion coefficients were determined. The cytosol results were found to be in very good agreement with those by FCS.},

abstract = {P2X receptors are membrane ion channels that open in response to the binding of extracellular ATP. Seven genes in vertebrates encode P2X receptor subunits, which are 40-50\% identical in amino acid sequence. Each subunit has two transmembrane domains, separated by an extracellular domain (approximately 280 amino acids). Channels form as multimers of several subunits. Homomeric P2X1, P2X2, P2X3, P2X4, P2X5, and P2X7 channels and heteromeric P2X2/3 and P2X1/5 channels have been most fully characterized following heterologous expression. Some agonists (e.g., alphabeta-methylene ATP) and antagonists [e.g., 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP] are strongly selective for receptors containing P2X1 and P2X3 subunits. All P2X receptors are permeable to small monovalent cations; some have significant calcium or anion permeability. In many cells, activation of homomeric P2X7 receptors induces a permeability increase to larger organic cations including some fluorescent dyes and also signals to the cytoskeleton; these changes probably involve additional interacting proteins. P2X receptors are abundantly distributed, and functional responses are seen in neurons, glia, epithelia, endothelia, bone, muscle, and hemopoietic tissues. The molecular composition of native receptors is becoming understood, and some cells express more than one type of P2X receptor. On smooth muscles, P2X receptors respond to ATP released from sympathetic motor nerves (e.g., in ejaculation). On sensory nerves, they are involved in the initiation of afferent signals in several viscera (e.g., bladder, intestine) and play a key role in sensing tissue-damaging and inflammatory stimuli. Paracrine roles for ATP signaling through P2X receptors are likely in neurohypophysis, ducted glands, airway epithelia, kidney, bone, and hemopoietic tissues. In the last case, P2X7 receptor activation stimulates cytokine release by engaging intracellular signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Synaptic vesicle fusion is catalyzed by assembly of synaptic SNARE complexes, and is regulated by the synaptic vesicle GTP-binding protein Rab3 that binds to RIM and to rabphilin. RIM is a known physiological regulator of fusion, but the role of rabphilin remains obscure. We now show that rabphilin regulates recovery of synaptic vesicles from use-dependent depression, probably by a direct interaction with the SNARE protein SNAP-25. Deletion of rabphilin dramatically accelerates recovery of depressed synaptic responses; this phenotype is rescued by viral expression of wild-type rabphilin, but not of mutant rabphilin lacking the second rabphilin C2 domain that binds to SNAP-25. Moreover, deletion of rabphilin also increases the size of synaptic responses in synapses lacking the vesicular SNARE protein synaptobrevin in which synaptic responses are severely depressed. Our data suggest that binding of rabphilin to SNAP-25 regulates exocytosis of synaptic vesicles after the readily releasable pool has either been physiologically exhausted by use-dependent depression, or has been artificially depleted by deletion of synaptobrevin.},

abstract = {Excitatory amino acids act via receptor subtypes in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). The receptor selectively activated by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) has been best characterized using voltage-clamp and single-channel recording; the results suggest that NMDA receptors gate channels that are permeable to Na$^+$, K$^+$ and other monovalent cations. Various experiments suggest that Ca$^{2+}$ flux is also associated with the activation of excitatory amino-acid receptors on vertebrate neurones. Whether Ca$^{2+}$ enters through voltage-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ channels or through excitatory amino-acid-activated channels of one or more subtype is unclear. Mg2+ can be used to distinguish NMDA-receptor-activated channels from voltage-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ channels, because at micromolar concentrations Mg2+ has little effect on voltage-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ channels while it enters and blocks NMDA receptor channels. Marked differences in the potency of other divalent cations acting as Ca$^{2+}$ channel blockers compared with their action as NMDA antagonists also distinguish the NMDA channel from voltage-sensitive Ca$^{2+}$ channels. However, we now directly demonstrate that excitatory amino acids acting at NMDA receptors on spinal cord neurones increase the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ activity, measured using the indicator dye arsenazo III, and that this is the result of Ca$^{2+}$ influx through NMDA receptor channels. Kainic acid (KA), which acts at another subtype of excitatory amino-acid receptor, was much less effective in triggering increases in intracellular free Ca$^{2+}$.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal abnormalities in the frequency and amplitude of the cytosolic calcium oscillations can impact the normal physiological functions of neuronal cells. Recent studies have shown that ketamine can affect the growth and development and even induce the apoptotic death of neurons. This study used isolated developing hippocampal neurons as its study subjects to observe the effect of ketamine on the intracellular calcium oscillations in developing hippocampal neurons and to further explore its underlying mechanism using Fluo-4-loaded laser scanning confocal microscopy. Using a semi-quantitative method to analyze the spontaneous calcium oscillatory activities, a typical type of calcium oscillation was observed in developing hippocampal neurons. In addition, the administration of NMDA (N-Methyl-D-aspartate) at a concentration of 100 µM increased the calcium oscillation amplitude. The administration of MK801 at a concentration of 40 µM inhibited the amplitude and frequency of the calcium oscillations. Our results demonstrated that an increase in the ketamine concentration, starting from 30 µM, gradually decreased the neuronal calcium oscillation amplitude. The inhibition of the calcium oscillation frequency by 300 µM ketamine was statistically significant, and the neuronal calcium oscillations were completely eliminated with the administration of 3,000 µM Ketamine. The administration of 100, 300, and 1,000 µM NMDA to the 1 mM ketamine-pretreated hippocampal neurons restored the frequency and amplitude of the calcium oscillations in a dose-dependent manner. In fact, a concentration of 1,000 µM NMDA completely reversed the decrease in the calcium oscillation frequency and amplitude that was induced by 1 mM ketamine. This study revealed that ketamine can inhibit the frequency and amplitude of the calcium oscillations in developing hippocampal neurons though the NMDAR (NMDA receptor) in a dose-dependent manner, which might highlight a possible underlying mechanism of ketamine toxicity on the rat hippocampal neurons during development.},

abstract = {Mitochondria from diverse organisms are capable of transporting large amounts of Ca$^{2+}$ via a ruthenium-red-sensitive, membrane-potential-dependent mechanism called the uniporter. Although the uniporter's biophysical properties have been studied extensively, its molecular composition remains elusive. We recently used comparative proteomics to identify MICU1 (also known as CBARA1), an EF-hand-containing protein that serves as a putative regulator of the uniporter. Here, we use whole-genome phylogenetic profiling, genome-wide RNA co-expression analysis and organelle-wide protein coexpression analysis to predict proteins functionally related to MICU1. All three methods converge on a novel predicted transmembrane protein, CCDC109A, that we now call 'mitochondrial calcium uniporter' (MCU). MCU forms oligomers in the mitochondrial inner membrane, physically interacts with MICU1, and resides within a large molecular weight complex. Silencing MCU in cultured cells or in vivo in mouse liver severely abrogates mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake, whereas mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential remain fully intact. MCU has two predicted transmembrane helices, which are separated by a highly conserved linker facing the intermembrane space. Acidic residues in this linker are required for its full activity. However, an S259A point mutation retains function but confers resistance to Ru360, the most potent inhibitor of the uniporter. Our genomic, physiological, biochemical and pharmacological data firmly establish MCU as an essential component of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter.},

abstract = {A proper cooperation between the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria seems to be essential for numerous cellular processes involved in Ca$^{2+}$ signalling and maintenance of Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis. A presence of microsomal and mitochondrial proteins together with those characteristic for the plasma membrane in the fraction of the plasma membrane associated membranes (PAM) indicates a formation of stabile interactions between these three structures. We isolated the plasma membrane associated membranes from Jurkat cells and found its significant enrichment in the plasma membrane markers including plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase and CD3 as well as sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{2+}$ ATPase as a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum membranes. In addition, two proteins involved in the store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry, Orai1 located in the plasma membrane and an endoplasmic reticulum protein STIM1 were found in this fraction. Furthermore, we observed a rearrangement of STIM1-containing protein complexes isolated from Jurkat cells undergoing stimulation by thapsigargin. We suggest that the inter-membrane compartment composed of the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum, and isolated as a stabile plasma membrane associated membranes fraction, might be involved in the store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry, and their formation and rebuilding have an important regulatory role in cellular Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis.},

abstract = {Apoptosis is a crucial process that regulates the homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Impaired apoptosis contributes to cancer development, while enhanced apoptosis is detrimental in neurodegenerative diseases. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Research published in the recent decade has suggested that cytochrome c release can be influenced by the conducting states of VDAC, the channel in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) responsible for metabolite flux. This review will describe the evidence that VDAC gating or blockage and subsequent changes in MOM permeability influence cytochrome c release and the onset of apoptosis. The blockage of VDAC by G3139, a proapoptotic phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, provides strong evidence for the role of VDAC in the initiation of apoptosis. The proapoptotic activity and VDAC blockage are linked in that both require the PS (phosphorothioate) modification, both are enhanced by an increase in oligonucleotide length, and both are insensitive to the nucleotide sequence. Thus, the mitochondrial outer membrane permeability regulated by VDAC gating may play an important role in mitochondrial function and in the control of apoptosis. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: VDAC structure, function, and regulation of mitochondrial metabolism.},

abstract = {Mitochondria are essential for ensuring numerous fundamental physiological processes such as cellular energy, redox balance, modulation of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling and important biosynthetic pathways. They also govern the cell fate by participating in the apoptosis pathway. The mitochondrial shape, volume, number and distribution within the cells are strictly controlled. The regulation of these parameters has an impact on mitochondrial function, especially in the central nervous system, where trafficking of mitochondria is critical to their strategic intracellular distribution, presumably according to local energy demands. Thus, the maintenance of a healthy mitochondrial population is essential to avoid the impairment of the processes they regulate: for this purpose, cells have developed mechanisms involving a complex system of quality control to remove damaged mitochondria, or to renew them. Defects of these processes impair mitochondrial function and lead to disordered cell function, i.e., to a disease condition. Given the standard role of mitochondria in all cells, it might be expected that their dysfunction would give rise to similar defects in all tissues. However, damaged mitochondrial function has pleiotropic effects in multicellular organisms, resulting in diverse pathological conditions, ranging from cardiac and brain ischemia, to skeletal muscle myopathies to neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will focus on the relationship between mitochondrial (and cellular) derangements and Ca$^{2+}$ dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the evidence obtained in genetic models. Common patterns, that recognize the derangement of Ca$^{2+}$ and energy control as a causative factor, have been identified: advances in the understanding of the molecular regulation of Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis, and on the ways in which it could become perturbed in neurological disorders, may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies that modulate neuronal Ca$^{2+}$ signaling.},

Despite major efforts, the molecular nature of the PTP remains elusive. A compound library screening led to the identification of a novel high affinity PTP inhibitor (Ro 68-3400), which labeled a approximately 32 kDa protein that was identified as isoform 1 of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) [A.M. Cesura, E. Pinard, R. Schubenel, V. Goetschy, A. Friedlein, H. Langen, P. Polcic, M.A. Forte, P. Bernardi, J.A.

In order to assess the role of VDAC1 in PTP formation and activity, we have studied the properties of mitochondria from VDAC1(-/-) mice. The basic properties of the PTP in VDAC1(-/-) mitochondria were indistinguishable from those of strain-matched mitochondria from wild-type CD1 mice, including inhibition by Ro 68-3400, which labeled identical proteins of 32 kDa in both wild-type and VDAC1(-/-) mitochondria. The labeled protein could be separated from all VDAC isoforms. While these results do not allow to exclude that VDAC is part of the PTP, they suggest that VDAC is not the target for PTP inhibition by Ro 68-3400.},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ entry into cells of the peripheral immune system occurs through highly Ca$^{2+}$-selective channels known as CRAC (calcium release-activated calcium) channels. CRAC channels are a very well-characterized example of store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ channels, so designated because they open when the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca$^{2+}$ store becomes depleted. Physiologically, Ca$^{2+}$ is released from the ER lumen into the cytoplasm when activated receptors couple to phospholipase C and trigger production of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)). IP(3) binds to IP(3) receptors in the ER membrane and activates Ca$^{2+}$ release. The proteins STIM and ORAI were discovered through limited and genome-wide RNAi screens, respectively, performed in Drosophila cells and focused on identifying modulators of store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry. STIM1 and STIM2 sense the depletion of ER Ca$^{2+}$ stores, whereas ORAI1 is a pore subunit of the CRAC channel. In this review, we discuss selected aspects of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in cells of the immune system, focusing on the roles of STIM and ORAI proteins in store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry.},

abstract = {Certain members of the Bcl-2 family inhibit apoptosis while others facilitate this physiological process of cell death. An expression screen for proteins that bind to Bcl-2 yielded a small novel protein, denoted Bim, whose only similarity to any known protein is the short (nine amino acid) BH3 motif shared by most Bcl-2 homologues. Bim provokes apoptosis, and the BH3 region is required for Bcl-2 binding and for most of its cytotoxicity. Like Bcl-2, Bim possesses a hydrophobic C-terminus and localizes to intracytoplasmic membranes. Three Bim isoforms, probably generated by alternative splicing, all induce apoptosis, the shortest being the most potent. Wild-type Bcl-2 associates with Bim in vivo and modulates its death function, whereas Bcl-2 mutants that lack survival function do neither. Significantly, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, the two closest homologues of Bcl-2, also bind to Bim and inhibit its activity, but more distant viral homologues, adenovirus E1B19K and Epstein-Barr virus BHRF-1, can do neither. Hence, Bim appears to act as a 'death ligand' which can only neutralize certain members of the pro-survival Bcl-2 sub-family.},

abstract = {The calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) is the simplest and most versatile intracellular messenger known. The discovery of Ca$^{2+}$ sparks and a related family of elementary Ca$^{2+}$ signaling events has revealed fundamental principles of the Ca$^{2+}$ signaling system. A newly appreciated "digital" subsystem consisting of brief, high Ca$^{2+}$ concentration over short distances (nanometers to microns) comingles with an "analog" global Ca$^{2+}$ signaling subsystem. Over the past 15 years, much has been learned about the theoretical and practical aspects of spark formation and detection. The quest for the spark mechanisms [the activation, coordination, and termination of Ca$^{2+}$ release units (CRUs)] has met unexpected challenges, however, and raised vexing questions about CRU operation in situ. Ample evidence shows that Ca$^{2+}$ sparks catalyze many high-threshold Ca$^{2+}$ processes involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling, vascular tone regulation, membrane excitability, and neuronal secretion. Investigation of Ca$^{2+}$ sparks in diseases has also begun to provide novel insights into hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and muscular dystrophy. An emerging view is that spatially and temporally patterned activation of the digital subsystem confers on intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling an exquisite architecture in space, time, and intensity, which underpins signaling efficiency, stability, specificity, and diversity. These recent advances in "sparkology" thus promise to unify the simplicity and complexity of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in biology.},

abstract = {We describe a finite-element model of mast cell calcium dynamics that incorporates the endoplasmic reticulum's complex geometry. The model is built upon a three-dimensional reconstruction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from an electron tomographic tilt series. Tetrahedral meshes provide volumetric representations of the ER lumen, ER membrane, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane. The reaction-diffusion model simultaneously tracks changes in cytoplasmic and ER intraluminal calcium concentrations and includes luminal and cytoplasmic protein buffers. Transport fluxes via PMCA, SERCA, ER leakage, and Type II IP3 receptors are also represented. Unique features of the model include stochastic behavior of IP3 receptor calcium channels and comparisons of channel open times when diffusely distributed or aggregated in clusters on the ER surface. Simulations show that IP3R channels in close proximity modulate activity of their neighbors through local Ca$^{2+}$ feedback effects. Cytoplasmic calcium levels rise higher, and ER luminal calcium concentrations drop lower, after IP3-mediated release from receptors in the diffuse configuration. Simulation results also suggest that the buffering capacity of the ER, and not restricted diffusion, is the predominant factor influencing average luminal calcium concentrations.},

@article{Duncan2000,
abstract = {Concerted effort has led to the identification of dozens of synaptic proteins and has thereby opened the door for the characterisation of the molecular mechanisms underlying regulated exocytosis. Calcium is known to play a number of roles in regulated exocytosis, acting as the trigger for fast synaptic transmission and also acting at some of the steps preceding vesicle fusion. Investigators have therefore focussed considerable attention on possible calcium sensors. What many of the candidate proteins have in common is a C2 domain, one of the four conserved domains originally described in protein kinase C. Such domains have been shown to bind calcium and phospholipid in a large number of intracellular proteins. Synaptotagmin, a C2-domain protein, is a very strong candidate for the protein involved in triggering fast calcium-dependent vesicle fusion. Recent attention has also concerned the other calcium sensors, which may play roles in the 'priming' or transport of vesicles. This review concerns one of these tentative calcium-binding proteins, double C2 or DOC2. DOC2 was originally isolated from nervous tissue but subsequently has been found to be more widely expressed. DOC2 is a vesicular protein that may be involved in the early stages of preparing vesicles for exocytosis.},

abstract = {Research over the past decade has extended the prevailing view of the mitochondrion to include functions well beyond the generation of cellular energy. It is now recognized that mitochondria play a crucial role in cell signaling events, inter-organellar communication, aging, cell proliferation, diseases and cell death. Thus, mitochondria play a central role in the regulation of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and serve as the venue for cellular decisions leading to cell life or death. One of the mitochondrial proteins controlling cell life and death is the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), also known as mitochondrial porin. VDAC, located in the mitochondrial outer membrane, functions as gatekeeper for the entry and exit of mitochondrial metabolites, thereby controlling cross-talk between mitochondria and the rest of the cell. VDAC is also a key player in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Thus, in addition to regulating the metabolic and energetic functions of mitochondria, VDAC appears to be a convergence point for a variety of cell survival and cell death signals mediated by its association with various ligands and proteins. In this article, we review what is known about the VDAC channel in terms of its structure, relevance to ATP rationing, Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis, protection against oxidative stress, regulation of apoptosis, involvement in several diseases and its role in the action of different drugs. In light of our recent findings and the recently solved NMR- and crystallography-based 3D structures of VDAC1, the focus of this review will be on the central role of VDAC in cell life and death, addressing VDAC function in the regulation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis with an emphasis on structure-function relations. Understanding structure-function relationships of VDAC is critical for deciphering how this channel can perform such a variety of functions, all important for cell life and death. This review also provides insight into the potential of VDAC1 as a rational target for new therapeutics.},

abstract = {The Ca$^{2+}$ ion serves as a ubiquitous second messenger in eukaryotic cells and changes in the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration regulate many responses within a cell, but also communication between cells. In order to make use of such an apparently simple signal, i.e. a change in the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration, cells are equipped with sophisticated machinery to precisely regulate the shape (amplitude, duration) of Ca$^{2+}$ signals in a localization-specific manner. To ascertain such a precise regulation, cells rely on the components of the Ca$^{2+}$ signaling toolkit. This embraces Ca$^{2+}$ entry systems including Ca$^{2+}$ channels in the plasma membrane and organellar membranes, and Ca$^{2+}$ extrusion/uptake systems including Ca$^{2+}$-ATPases (Ca$^{2+}$ pumps) and Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchangers. Besides mitochondria, organelles implicated also in Ca$^{2+}$ signaling, cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ buffers are cell-specific subtle modulators of Ca$^{2+}$ signals. The Ca$^{2+}$-signaling components not only orchestrate their activity as to ascertain the high accuracy of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling, but they are also implicated in the regulation of their own expression. The total of the molecules that build the network of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling components, and that are involved in their own regulation as to maintain physiological Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis resulting in phenotypic stability is named the Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasome. Mechanistic details on the functioning of the Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasome are presented.},

abstract = {The nine-variable De Young-Keizer model (1992) for [Ca$^{2+}$]i oscillations mediated by InsP3 receptor channels in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is analyzed and reduced to a two-variable system. The different time scales in the three basic channel gating processes, namely InsP3 regulation, Ca$^{2+}$ activation, and Ca$^{2+}$ inactivation, are revealed and characterized. The method of multiple scales is used in solving the equations on a succession of faster time scales and reducing them to a 2D system. The reduced system, (Vcy/fcy) dC/dt = -P1P3Rm3 infinity h3(C-C0)-PL(C-C0)-Jpump(C); dh/dt = (h infinity-h)/tau h, is analogous in form to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for plasma membrane electrical excitability. [Ca$^{2+}$]i dynamics in this model thus involve ER membrane-associated excitability. The reduced system has a bifurcation diagram almost identical to that of the original system and retains the most important dynamic features of the latter. The analysis also shows that the reduced system becomes simpler when the different gating processes are more independent from each other, i.e. when the rates for Ca$^{2+}$ binding at the site associated with one gating process are independent of occupancy at the other two binding sites. Assuming further that binding of InsP3 does not depend on Ca$^{2+}$ occupancy at the inactivation site, we obtain a "minimal" form yet retain significant ability to reproduce experimental observations.},

abstract = {The Ca$^{2+}$ ATPases of the plasma membrane (PMCA pumps) export Ca$^{2+}$ from all eukaryotic cells. In mammals they are the products of four separate genes. PMCA types 1 and 4 are distributed ubiquitously; PMCA types 2 and 3 are restricted to some tissues, the most important being the nervous system. Alternative splicing at two sites greatly increases the number of pump isoforms. The two ubiquitous isoforms are no longer considered as only housekeeping pumps as they also perform tissue-specific functions. The PMCAs are classical P-type pumps, their reaction cycle repeating that of all other pumps of the family. Their 3D structure has not been solved, but molecular modeling on SERCA pump templates shows the essential structural pattern of the latter. PMCAs are regulated by calmodulin, which interacts with high affinity with their cytosolic C-terminal tail. A second calmodulin-binding domain with lower affinity is present in some splicing variants of the pump. The PMCAs are essential to the regulation of cellular Ca$^{2+}$, but the all-important Ca$^{2+}$ signal is ambivalent: defects in its control generate various pathologies, the most thoroughly studied being those of genetic origin. Genetic defects of PMCA function produce disease phenotypes: the best characterized is a form of deafness in mice and in humans linked to PMCA2 mutations. A cerebellar X-linked human ataxia has recently been found to be caused by a mutation in the calmodulin-binding domain of PMCA3.},

abstract = {The effects of the toxin SXN482 on Ca$^{2+}$ channel currents (ICa), Na$^+$ currents (INa), and K$^+$ currents (IK) have been studied in bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells voltage-clamped at -80 mV. Currents were elicited by depolarising pulses to 0-10 mV (ICa and INa) or to +60 mV (IK). SNX482 blocked ICa in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition curve exhibited two phases. The first high-affinity phase comprised 28\% of the whole-cell current and exhibited an IC50 of 30.2 nM. The second low-affinity phase comprised over 70\% of ICa and had an IC50 of 758.6 nM. Blockade was rapid and fully reversible upon washout of the toxin. Occlusion experiments showed additivity of blockade exerted by nifedipine plus SNX482 (0.3 microM) and by omega-conotoxin GVIA plus SNX482. In contrast, blockade exerted by combined omega-agatoxin IVA plus SNX482 (about 50\% of the whole cell) did not show additivity. At 0.3 microM and higher concentrations, SNX482 delayed the inactivation of INa. The time constant (tau) for inactivation of INa in control conditions doubled in the presence of 0.5 microM SNX482. At 0.3 microM, SNX482 did not affect IK. Our data demonstrate that: (i) SNX482 selectively blocks P/Q Ca$^{2+}$ channels at submicromolar concentrations; (ii) the toxin partially blocks Na$^+$ channels; (iii) SNX482 delays the inactivation of Na$^+$ channels. These results reveal novel properties of SNX482 and cast doubts on the claimed selectivity and specificity of the toxin to block the R-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel.},

abstract = {Cytosolic calcium signals are produced by suddenly increasing the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca$^{2+}$). This can occur by opening channels permeable to Ca$^{2+}$ either in the surface cell membrane or in the membranes of intracellular organelles containing high Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations. Ca$^{2+}$ signals can control several different processes, even in the same cell. In pancreatic acinar cells, for example, Ca$^{2+}$ signals do not only control the normal secretion of digestive enzymes, but can also activate autodigestion and programmed cell death. Recent technical advances have shown that different patterns of Ca$^{2+}$ signals can be created, in space and time, which allow specific cellular responses to be elicited. The mechanisms responsible for Ca$^{2+}$ signal compartmentalization are now largely known and will be described on the basis of recent studies of Ca$^{2+}$ transport pathways and their regulation in pancreatic acinar cells. It turns out that the Ca$^{2+}$ handling as well as the structural characteristics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria are of particular importance. Using a variety of Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive fluorescent probes placed in different sub-cellular compartments in combination with local uncaging of caged Ca$^{2+}$, many new insights into Ca$^{2+}$ signal generation, compartmentalization and termination have recently been obtained.},

Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ channels of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) actually implement mitochondrial uptake from cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ rises. Despite great efforts in the past, the identity of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ channels is still elusive. Numerous studies aimed to characterize mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniport channels and provided a detailed profile of these great unknowns with important functions.

abstract = {During intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signalling mitochondria accumulate significant amounts of Ca$^{2+}$ from the cytosol. Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake controls the rate of energy production, shapes the amplitude and spatio-temporal patterns of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals, and is instrumental to cell death. This Ca$^{2+}$ uptake is undertaken by the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter (MCU) located in the organelle's inner membrane. The uniporter passes Ca$^{2+}$ down the electrochemical gradient maintained across this membrane without direct coupling to ATP hydrolysis or transport of other ions. Carriers are characterized by turnover numbers that are typically 1,000-fold lower than ion channels, and until now it has been unclear whether the MCU is a carrier or a channel. By patch-clamping the inner mitochondrial membrane, we identified a previously unknown Ca$^{2+}$-selective ion channel sensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. Our data indicate that this unique channel binds Ca$^{2+}$ with extremely high affinity (dissociation constant < or =2 nM), enabling high Ca$^{2+}$ selectivity despite relatively low cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations. The channel is inwardly rectifying, making it especially effective for Ca$^{2+}$ uptake into energized mitochondria. Thus, we conclude that the properties of the current mediated by this novel channel are those of the MCU.},

abstract = {Calcium signals mediate diverse cellular functions in immunological cells. Early studies with mast cells, then a preeminent model for studying Ca$^{2+}$-dependent exocytosis, revealed several basic features of calcium signaling in non-electrically excitable cells. Subsequent studies in these and other cells further defined the basic processes such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated release of Ca$^{2+}$ from Ca$^{2+}$ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); coupling of ER store depletion to influx of external Ca$^{2+}$ through a calcium-release activated calcium (CRAC) channel now attributed to the interaction of the ER Ca$^{2+}$ sensor, stromal interacting molecule-1 (STIM1), with a unique Ca$^{2+}$-channel protein, Orai1/CRACM1, and subsequent uptake of excess Ca$^{2+}$ into ER and mitochondria through ATP-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ pumps. In addition, transient receptor potential channels and ion exchangers also contribute to the generation of calcium signals that may be global or have dynamic (e.g., waves and oscillations) and spatial resolution for specific functional readouts. This review discusses past and recent developments in this field of research, the pharmacologic agents that have assisted in these endeavors, and the mast cell as an exemplar for sorting out how calcium signals may regulate multiple outputs in a single cell.},

abstract = {Calcium is an ambivalent signal: it is essential for the correct functioning of cell life, but may also become dangerous to it. The plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$ ATPase (PMCA) and the plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger (NCX) are the two mechanisms responsible for Ca$^{2+}$ extrusion. The NCX has low Ca$^{2+}$ affinity but high capacity for Ca$^{2+}$ transport, whereas the PMCA has a high Ca$^{2+}$ affinity but low transport capacity for it. Thus, traditionally, the PMCA pump has been attributed a housekeeping role in maintaining cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$, and the NCX the dynamic role of counteracting large cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ variations (especially in excitable cells). This view of the roles of the two Ca$^{2+}$ extrusion systems has been recently revised, as the specific functional properties of the numerous PMCA isoforms and splicing variants suggests that they may have evolved to cover both the basal Ca$^{2+}$ regulation (in the 100 nM range) and the Ca$^{2+}$ transients generated by cell stimulation (in the $\mu$M range).},

abstract = {Energy supply is the most prominent function of mitochondria, but in addition, mitochondria are indispensable for a multitude of other important cellular functions including calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) signaling and buffering, the supply of metabolites and the sequestration of apoptotic factors. The efficiency of those functions highly depends on the proper positioning of mitochondria within the cytosol. In lymphocytes, mitochondria preferentially localize into the vicinity (∼200nm) of the immune synapse (IS). This localization is regulated by motor-based cytoskeleton-mediated transport, the fusion/fission dynamics of mitochondria, and probably also through tethering with the ER. IS formation also induces the accumulation of CRAC/ORAI1 Ca$^{2+}$ channels, the CRAC/ORAI channel activator STIM1, K(+) channels and plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$ ATPase (PMCA) within the IS. Such a large agglomeration of Ca$^{2+}$ binding organelles and proteins highlights the IS as a critical cellular compartment for Ca$^{2+}$ dependent lymphocyte activation. At the IS, Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains generated beneath open CRAC/ORAI channels provide a rapid, robust and reliable mechanism for driving cellular responses in mast cells and T cells. Here, we discuss the relevance of motor-based mitochondrial transport, fusion, fission and tethering for mitochondrial localization in T cells and the importance of subplasmalemmal mitochondria to control local CRAC/ORAI1-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains at the IS for efficient T lymphocyte activation.},

abstract = {Store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry (SOCE) is an important Ca$^{2+}$ influx pathway in many non-excitable and some excitable cells. It is regulated by the filling state of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ stores, notably the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Reduction in [Ca$^{2+}$]ER results in activation of plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$ channels that mediate sustained Ca$^{2+}$ influx which is required for many cell functions as well as refilling of Ca$^{2+}$ stores. The Ca$^{2+}$ release activated Ca$^{2+}$ (CRAC) channel is the best characterized SOC channel with well-defined electrophysiological properties. In recent years, the molecular components of the CRAC channel, long mysterious, have been defined. ORAI1 (or CRACM1) acts as the pore-forming subunit of the CRAC channel in the plasma membrane. Stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1 is localized in the ER, senses [Ca$^{2+}$]ER, and activates the CRAC channel upon store depletion by binding to ORAI1. Both proteins are widely expressed in many tissues in both human and mouse consistent with the widespread prevalence of SOCE and CRAC channel currents in many cells types. CRAC channelopathies in human patients with mutations in STIM1 and ORAI1 are characterized by abolished CRAC channel currents, lack of SOCE and-clinically-immunodeficiency, congenital myopathy, and anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia. This article reviews the role of ORAI and STIM proteins for SOCE and CRAC channel function in a variety of cell types and tissues and compares the phenotypes of ORAI1 and STIM1-deficient human patients and mice with targeted deletion of Orai and Stim genes.},

It has recently become clear that the MAM also enables highly efficient transmission of Ca$^{2+}$ from the ER to mitochondria to stimulate oxidative metabolism and, conversely, might enable the metabolically energized mitochondria to regulate the ER Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis. Recent studies have shed light on molecular chaperones such as calnexin, calreticulin, ERp44, ERp57, grp75 and the sigma-1 receptor at the MAM, which regulate the association between the two organelles. The MAM thus integrates signal transduction with metabolic pathways to regulate the communication and functional interactions between the ER and mitochondrion.},

abstract = {Considerable insight into intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ responses has been obtained through the development of whole cell models that are based on molecular mechanisms, e.g., single channel kinetics of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor Ca$^{2+}$ channel. However, a limitation of most whole cell models to date is the assumption that IP3 receptor Ca$^{2+}$ channels (IP3Rs) are globally coupled by a "continuously stirred" bulk cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$], when in fact open IP3Rs experience elevated "domain" Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations. Here we present a 2N+2-compartment whole cell model of local and global Ca$^{2+}$ responses mediated by N=100,000 diffusely distributed IP3Rs, each represented by a four-state Markov chain. Two of these compartments correspond to bulk cytosolic and luminal Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations, and the remaining 2N compartments represent time-dependent cytosolic and luminal Ca$^{2+}$ domains associated with each IP3R. Using this Monte Carlo model as a starting point, we present an alternative formulation that solves a system of advection-reaction equations for the probability density of cytosolic and luminal domain [Ca$^{2+}$] jointly distributed with IP3R state. When these equations are coupled to ordinary differential equations for the bulk cytosolic and luminal [Ca$^{2+}$], a realistic but minimal model of whole cell Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics is produced that accounts for the influence of local Ca$^{2+}$ signaling on channel gating and global Ca$^{2+}$ responses. The probability density approach is benchmarked and validated by comparison to Monte Carlo simulations, and the two methods are shown to agree when the number of Ca$^{2+}$ channels is large (i.e., physiologically realistic). Using the probability density approach, we show that the time scale of Ca$^{2+}$ domain formation and collapse (both cytosolic and luminal) may influence global Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations, and we derive two reduced models of global Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics that account for the influence of local Ca$^{2+}$ signaling on global Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics when there is a separation of time scales between the stochastic gating of IP3Rs and the dynamics of domain Ca$^{2+}$.},

abstract = {The calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) is the simplest and most versatile intracellular messenger known. The discovery of Ca$^{2+}$ sparks and a related family of elementary Ca$^{2+}$ signaling events has revealed fundamental principles of the Ca$^{2+}$ signaling system. A newly appreciated "digital" subsystem consisting of brief, high Ca$^{2+}$ concentration over short distances (nanometers to microns) comingles with an "analog" global Ca$^{2+}$ signaling subsystem. Over the past 15 years, much has been learned about the theoretical and practical aspects of spark formation and detection. The quest for the spark mechanisms [the activation, coordination, and termination of Ca$^{2+}$ release units (CRUs)] has met unexpected challenges, however, and raised vexing questions about CRU operation in situ. Ample evidence shows that Ca$^{2+}$ sparks catalyze many high-threshold Ca$^{2+}$ processes involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling, vascular tone regulation, membrane excitability, and neuronal secretion. Investigation of Ca$^{2+}$ sparks in diseases has also begun to provide novel insights into hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and muscular dystrophy. An emerging view is that spatially and temporally patterned activation of the digital subsystem confers on intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling an exquisite architecture in space, time, and intensity, which underpins signaling efficiency, stability, specificity, and diversity. These recent advances in "sparkology" thus promise to unify the simplicity and complexity of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in biology.},

abstract = {Cells have intrinsic signalling mechanisms that are capable of sensing various deleterious conditions, both normal and pathological, and respond by mounting a variety of stress responses. Examples of normal signals are the cytokines that induce inflammatory responses in cells. Pathological signals include UV and X-ray irradiation, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), abrupt anoxia and physicochemical injury through heat or noxious chemicals. A process of wound healing can function to repair the damage caused by such injuries. In many cases, especially if the stress signal is not too severe, the cell can survive and can even become tolerant to further insults. If cells are growing, such sub-lethal insults can either cause the cell to stop growing temporarily to allow adequate time to repair the damage, or the process of cell proliferation can be stopped more permanently and the cell will enter a state of senescence . Another example of an evolutionarily conserved survival mechanism is autophagy , which enables cells to cope with periods of starvation. If such stresses become too severe, however, the cell dies, either through a process of necrosis, which is rapid and catastrophic, or through a slower and more controlled process that is carried out by a highly regulated process of programmed cell death known as apoptosis .},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ may trigger apoptosis in $\beta$-cells. Hence, the control of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ may represent a potential approach to prevent $\beta$-cell apoptosis in diabetes. Our objective was to investigate the effect and mechanism of action of plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase (PMCA) overexpression on Ca$^{2+}$-regulated apoptosis in clonal $\beta$-cells. Clonal $\beta$-cells (BRIN-BD11) were examined for the effect of PMCA overexpression on cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] using a combination of aequorins with different Ca$^{2+}$ affinities and on the ER and mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. $\beta$-cell stimulation generated microdomains of high [Ca$^{2+}$] in the cytosol and subcellular heterogeneities in [Ca$^{2+}$] among mitochondria. Overexpression of PMCA decreased [Ca$^{2+}$] in the cytosol, the ER, and the mitochondria and activated the IRE1$\alpha$-XBP1s but inhibited the PRKR-like ER kinase-eIF2$\alpha$ and the ATF6-BiP pathways of the ER-unfolded protein response. Increased Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio was observed in PMCA overexpressing $\beta$-cells. This was followed by Bax translocation to the mitochondria with subsequent cytochrome c release, opening of the permeability transition pore, and apoptosis. In conclusion, clonal $\beta$-cell stimulation generates microdomains of high [Ca$^{2+}$] in the cytosol and subcellular heterogeneities in [Ca$^{2+}$] among mitochondria. PMCA overexpression depletes intracellular [Ca$^{2+}$] stores and, despite a decrease in mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$], induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. These data open the way to new strategies to control cellular Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis that could decrease $\beta$-cell apoptosis in diabetes.},

abstract = {Intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ is vital for cell physiology. Disruption of Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis contributes to human diseases such as heart failure, neuron-degeneration, and diabetes. To ensure an effective intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics, various Ca$^{2+}$ transport proteins localized in different cellular regions have to work in coordination. The central role of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport mechanisms in responding to physiological Ca$^{2+}$ pulses in cytosol is to take up Ca$^{2+}$ for regulating energy production and shaping the amplitude and duration of Ca$^{2+}$ transients in various micro-domains. Since the discovery that isolated mitochondria can take up large quantities of Ca$^{2+}$ approximately 5 decades ago, extensive studies have been focused on the functional characterization and implication of ion channels that dictate Ca$^{2+}$ transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake sensitive to non-specific inhibitors ruthenium red and Ru360 has long been considered as the activity of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter (MCU). The general consensus is that MCU is dominantly or exclusively responsible for the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ influx. Since multiple Ca$^{2+}$ influx mechanisms (e.g. L-, T-, and N-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel) have their unique functions in the plasma membrane, it is plausible that mitochondrial inner membrane has more than just MCU to decode complex intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in various cell types. During the last decade, four molecular identities related to mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ influx mechanisms have been identified. These are mitochondrial ryanodine receptor, mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, LETM1 (Ca$^{2+}$/H(+) exchanger), and MCU and its Ca$^{2+}$ sensing regulatory subunit MICU1. Here, we briefly review recent progress in these and other reported mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ influx pathways and their differences in kinetics, Ca$^{2+}$ dependence, and pharmacological characteristics. Their potential physiological and pathological implications are also discussed.},

An overview of recent approaches that have been undertaken to ensure that the GECIs are minimally perturbed by the cellular environment is provided. Additionally, the procedures for introducing GECIs into mammalian cells, conducting calcium imaging experiments, and analyzing data are discussed.

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) produced by vascular endothelial cells is a potent vasodilator and an antiinflammatory mediator. Regulating production of endothelial-derived NO is a complex undertaking, involving multiple signaling and genetic pathways that are activated by diverse humoral and biomechanical stimuli. To gain a thorough understanding of the rich diversity of responses observed experimentally, it is necessary to account for an ensemble of these pathways acting simultaneously. In this article, we have assembled four quantitative molecular pathways previously proposed for shear-stress-induced NO production. In these pathways, endothelial NO synthase is activated 1), via calcium release, 2), via phosphorylation reactions, and 3), via enhanced protein expression. To these activation pathways, we have added a fourth, a pathway describing actual NO production from endothelial NO synthase and its various protein partners. These pathways were combined and simulated using CytoSolve, a computational environment for combining independent pathway calculations. The integrated model is able to describe the experimentally observed change in NO production with time after the application of fluid shear stress. This model can also be used to predict the specific effects on the system after interventional pharmacological or genetic changes. Importantly, this model reflects the up-to-date understanding of the NO system, providing a platform upon which information can be aggregated in an additive way.},

abstract = {Proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3-only protein Bim plays an important role in Bax/Bak-mediated cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Here, we provide evidence for a novel prosurvival function of Bim in cancer cells. Bim was constitutively overexpressed in multiple prostate and breast cancer cells as well as in primary tumor cells. Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed that Bim was transcriptionally up-regulated. We have identified eight endogenous E2F1-binding sites on the Bim promoter using in silico analysis. Luciferase assay demonstrated that Bim expression was E2F1-dependent as mutation of the E2F1-binding sites on the Bim promoter inhibited luciferase activities. In support, E2F1 silencing led to the loss of Bim expression in cancer cells. Bim primarily localized to mitochondrial and cytoskeleton-associated fractions. Bim silencing or microinjection of anti-Bim antibodies into the cell cytoplasm resulted in cell rounding, detachment, and subsequent apoptosis. We observed up-regulation of prosurvival proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, which sequester Bim in cancer cells. In addition, a phosphorylated form of Bim was also elevated in cancer cells. These findings suggest that the constitutively overexpressed Bim may function as a prosurvival molecule in epithelial cancer cells, and phosphorylation and association with Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 block its proapoptotic functions.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial calcium uptake is present in nearly all vertebrate tissues and is believed to be critical in shaping calcium signaling, regulating ATP synthesis and controlling cell death. Calcium uptake occurs through a channel called the uniporter that resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Recently, we used comparative genomics to identify MICU1 and MCU as the key regulatory and putative pore-forming subunits of this channel, respectively. Using bioinformatics, we now report that the human genome encodes two additional paralogs of MICU1, which we call MICU2 and MICU3, each of which likely arose by gene duplication and exhibits distinct patterns of organ expression. We demonstrate that MICU1 and MICU2 are expressed in HeLa and HEK293T cells, and provide multiple lines of biochemical evidence that MCU, MICU1 and MICU2 reside within a complex and cross-stabilize each other's protein expression in a cell-type dependent manner. Using in vivo RNAi technology to silence MICU1, MICU2 or both proteins in mouse liver, we observe an additive impairment in calcium handling without adversely impacting mitochondrial respiration or membrane potential. The results identify MICU2 as a new component of the uniporter complex that may contribute to the tissue-specific regulation of this channel.},

abstract = {Calcium handling by mitochondria is a key feature in cell life. It is involved in energy production for cell activity, in buffering and shaping cytosolic calcium rises and also in determining cell fate by triggering or preventing apoptosis. Both mitochondria and the mechanisms involved in the control of calcium homeostasis have been extensively studied, but they still provide researchers with long-standing or even new challenges. Technical improvements in the tools employed for the investigation of calcium dynamics have been-and are still-opening new perspectives in this field, and more prominently for mitochondria. In this review we present a state-of-the-art toolkit for calcium measurements, with major emphasis on the advantages of genetically encoded indicators. These indicators can be efficiently and selectively targeted to specific cellular sub-compartments, allowing previously unavailable high-definition calcium dynamic studies. We also summarize the main features of cellular and, in more detail, mitochondrial calcium handling, especially focusing on the latest breakthroughs in the field, such as the recent direct characterization of the calcium microdomains that occur on the mitochondrial surface upon cellular stimulation. Additionally, we provide a major example of the key role played by calcium in patho-physiology by briefly describing the extensively reported-albeit highly controversial-alterations of calcium homeostasis in Alzheimer's disease, casting lights on the possible alterations in mitochondrial calcium handling in this pathology.},

IP(3)Rs share many features with their close relatives, ryanodine receptors; each provides insight into the structure and function of the other. The structural basis of IP(3)R behaviour is beginning to emerge from intermediate-resolution structures of the complete IP(3)R, a 2.2-A structure of the IP(3)-binding core and comparisons with the pore structures of other tetrameric cation channels. The binding of IP(3) to a site towards the N-terminal of each IP(3)R subunit promotes binding of Ca$^{2+}$. This destabilizes an inhibitory interaction between N-terminal residues and a C-terminal 'gatekeeper' sequence, enabling the pore to open.},

abstract = {A decline in mitochondrial function plays a key role in the aging process and increases the incidence of age-related disorders. A deeper understanding of the intricate nature of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in several key pathologies associated with aging. Indeed, a recent wave of studies has demonstrated the pleiotropic role of fusion and fission proteins in numerous cellular processes, including mitochondrial metabolism, redox signaling, the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA and cell death. Additionally, mitochondrial fusion and fission, together with autophagy, have been proposed to form a quality-maintenance mechanism that facilitates the removal of damaged mitochondria from the cell, a process that is particularly important to forestall aging. Thus, dysfunctional regulation of mitochondrial dynamics might be one of the intrinsic causes of mitochondrial dysfunction, which contributes to oxidative stress and cell death during the aging process. In this Commentary, we discuss recent studies that have converged at a consensus regarding the involvement of mitochondrial dynamics in key cellular processes, and introduce a possible link between abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and aging.},

abstract = {Intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations are commonly observed in a large number of cell types in response to stimulation by an extracellular agonist. In most cell types the mechanism of regular spiking is well understood and models based on Ca$^{2+}$-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release (CICR) can account for many experimental observations. However, cells do not always exhibit simple Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. In response to given agonists, some cells show more complex behaviour in the form of bursting, i.e. trains of Ca$^{2+}$ spikes separated by silent phases. Here we develop several theoretical models, based on physiologically plausible assumptions, that could account for complex intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. The models are all based on one- or two-pool models based on CICR. We extend these models by (i) considering the inhibition of the Ca$^{2+}$-release channel on a unique intracellular store at high cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations, (ii) taking into account the Ca$^{2+}$-activated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), or (iii) considering explicity the evolution of the Ca$^{2+}$ concentration in two different pools, one sensitive and the other one insensitive to IP(3). Besides simple periodic oscillations, these three models can all account for more complex oscillatory behaviour in the form of bursting. Moreover, the model that takes the kinetics of IP(3) into account shows chaotic behaviour.},

It forms a 19-stranded beta barrel with the first and last strand parallel. The hydrophobic outside perimeter of the barrel is covered by detergent molecules in a beltlike fashion. In the presence of cholesterol, recombinant VDAC-1 can form voltage-gated channels in phospholipid bilayers similar to those of the native protein. NMR measurements revealed the binding sites of VDAC-1 for the Bcl-2 protein Bcl-x(L), for reduced beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and for cholesterol. Bcl-x(L) interacts with the VDAC barrel laterally at strands 17 and 18.},

abstract = {Evidence is accumulating that lipids play important roles in permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane (MOM) at the early stage of apoptosis. Lamellar phosphatidylcholine (PC) and nonlamellar phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids are the major membrane components of the MOM. Cardiolipin (CL), the characteristic lipid from the mitochondrial inner membrane, is another nonlamellar lipid recently shown to play a role in MOM permeabilization. We investigate the effect of these three key lipids on the gating properties of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), the major channel in MOM. We find that PE induces voltage asymmetry in VDAC current-voltage characteristics by promoting channel closure at cis negative applied potentials. Significant asymmetry is also induced by CL. The observed differences in VDAC behavior in PC and PE membranes cannot be explained by differences in the insertion orientation of VDAC in these membranes. Rather, it is clear that the two nonlamellar lipids affect VDAC gating. Using gramicidin A channels as a tool to probe bilayer mechanics, we show that VDAC channels are much more sensitive to the presence of CL than could be expected from the experiments with gramicidin channels. We suggest that this is due to the preferential insertion of VDAC into CL-rich domains. We propose that the specific lipid composition of the mitochondria outer membrane and/or of contact sites might influence MOM permeability by regulating VDAC gating.},

abstract = {Some dihydropyridines (DHPs), such as amlodipine and cilnidipine, have been shown to block not only L-type but also N-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels; therefore, DHPs are no longer considered as L-type-specific Ca$^{2+}$ channel blockers. However, selectivity of DHPs for Ca$^{2+}$ channel subtypes including N-, P/Q-, and R-types are poorly understood. To address this issue at the molecular level, blocking effects of 10 DHPs (nifedipine, nilvadipine, barnidipine, nimodipine, nitrendipine, amlodipine, nicardipine, benidipine, felodipine, and cilnidipine) on four subtypes of Ca$^{2+}$ channels (L-, N-, P/Q-, and R-types) were investigated in the Xenopus oocyte expression system with the use of the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels expressed as alpha(1C)alpha(2)beta(1a) combination were profoundly blocked by all DHPs examined, whereas blocking actions of these DHPs on R-type (alpha(1E)alpha(2)beta(1a)) channels were equally weak. In contrast, 5 of the 10 DHPs (amlodipine, benidipine, cilnidipine, nicardipine, and barnidipine) significantly blocked N-type (alpha(1B)alpha(2)beta(1a)) and P/Q-type (alpha(1A)alpha(2)beta(1a)) Ca$^{2+}$ channels. These selectivities of DHPs in blocking Ca$^{2+}$ channel subtypes would provide useful pharmacological and clinical information on the mode of action of the drugs including side effects and adverse effects.},

abstract = {Sodium-calcium antiporter is the primary efflux pathway for Ca$^{2+}$ in respiring mitochondria, and hence plays an important role in mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis. Although experimental data on the kinetics of Na(+)-Ca$^{2+}$ antiporter are available, the structure and composition of its functional unit and kinetic mechanisms associated with the Na(+)-Ca$^{2+}$ exchange (including the stoichiometry) remains unclear. To gain a quantitative understanding of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis, a biophysical model of Na(+)-Ca$^{2+}$ antiporter is introduced that is thermodynamically balanced and satisfactorily describes a number of independent data sets under a variety of experimental conditions. The model is based on a multistate catalytic binding mechanism for carrier-mediated facilitated transport and Eyring's free energy barrier theory for interconversion and electrodiffusion. The model predicts the activating effect of membrane potential on the antiporter function for a 3Na(+):1Ca$^{2+}$ electrogenic exchange as well as the inhibitory effects of both high and low pH seen experimentally. The model is useful for further development of mechanistic integrated models of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling and bioenergetics to understand the mechanisms by which Ca$^{2+}$ plays a role in mitochondrial signaling pathways and energy metabolism.},

We then proceed to discuss the differences between the two-pool and three-pool models by following the analysis of the two-pool model presented by Sneyd et al. [25]. The addition of the third pool does not change any of the dynamics of the two-pool model, but adds some functionality. The mitochondria acts like a buffer that has the ability to change the temporal dynamics, and we have a region of bistability that allows for dampened oscillations given the right stimulus and initial conditions.},

abstract = {Mitochondria have long been known to sequester cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and even to shape intracellular patterns of endoplasmic reticulum-based Ca$^{2+}$ signaling. Evidence suggests that the mitochondrial network is an excitable medium which can demonstrate independent Ca$^{2+}$ induced Ca$^{2+}$ release via the mitochondrial permeability transition. The role of this excitability remains unclear, but mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling appears to be a crucial element in diverse diseases as diabetes, neurodegeneration and cardiac dysfunction that also have bioenergetic components. In this paper, we extend the modular Magnus-Keizer computational model for respiration-driven Ca$^{2+}$ handling to include a permeability transition based on a channel-like pore mechanism. We demonstrate both excitability and Ca$^{2+}$ wave propagation accompanied by depolarizations qualitatively similar to those reported in cell and isolated mitochondria preparations. These waves depend on the energy state of the mitochondria, as well as other elements of mitochondrial physiology. Our results support the concept that mitochondria can transmit state dependent signals about their function across the mitochondrial network. Our model provides the tools for predictions about the internal physiology that leads to this qualitatively different Ca$^{2+}$ excitability seen in mitochondria.},

@article{Csordas2003,
abstract = {Evidence is emerging that a quasisynaptic local communication facilitates the calcium signaling between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. However, it remains elusive whether the machinery of mitochondrial calcium signaling displays plasticity similar to the synaptic transmission. Here we studied the relationship between inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-linked cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$]c) oscillations and the associated rise in mitochondrial matrix [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) in RBL-2H3 mast cells. We observed that the second [Ca$^{2+}$]c spike is often associated with a larger rise in the [Ca$^{2+}$]m than the first. It would appear that this phenomenon was not due to a change in the driving force for Ca$^{2+}$ uptake and therefore must be due to an enhanced Ca$^{2+}$ permeability of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake sites (uniporter). To investigate the activation and deactivation kinetics of the uniporter during IP3 receptor-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization, we established novel methods. Using these approaches, we demonstrated that the IP3-induced increase in the permeability of the uniporter lasted longer than the Ca$^{2+}$ signal. The sustained increase in Ca$^{2+}$ permeability was bidirectional. Furthermore, the addition of Ca$^{2+}$ during the decay of the IP3 effect evoked a large further increase in the uniporter permeability. Calmodulin inhibitors did not interfere with the IP3-induced initial activation of the uniporter but inhibited the sustained phase. These results suggest that the uniporter displays a calmodulin-mediated facilitation. This plasticity may allow cooperation among sequential IP3 receptor-mediated [Ca$^{2+}$] transients in the control of calcium signal propagation to the mitochondria.},

@article{Andrade2005,
abstract = {PURPOSE: The ultrafast extraocular muscles necessitate tight regulation of free cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]i). Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ influx may be fast enough for this role. In the present study, three hypotheses were tested: (1) Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake regulates [Ca$^{2+}$]i and production of force in extraocular muscle; (2) mitochondrial content correlates with their use as Ca$^{2+}$ sinks; and (3) mitochondrial content in extraocular muscle is determined by the transcription factors and coactivators that initiate muscle adaptation to aerobic exercise.

METHODS: Extraocular and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used to examine how the Ca$^{2+}$ release agonists caffeine and 4-chloro-3-ethylphenol (CEP), calcimycin (a Ca$^{2+}$ ionophore) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP; a mitochondrial uncoupler) alter [Ca$^{2+}$]i and force transients. Mitochondrial volume density and capillary density were analyzed by stereology and citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase by biochemical assays. Real-time PCR measured mRNAs of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.

RESULTS: Caffeine, CEP, and calcimycin increased resting [Ca$^{2+}$]i to a greater extent in EDL. Peak tetanic [Ca$^{2+}$]i increased in extraocular muscle with caffeine and CEP. CCCP augmented peak tetanic and submaximum [Ca$^{2+}$]i and force significantly more in extraocular muscles. Mitochondrial volume density and capillary density were three times greater, and citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase were only approximately 2-fold higher in extraocular muscle. Calcineurin Aalpha, calcineurin B, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)gamma were more abundant in extraocular muscle.

CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that mitochondria serve as Ca$^{2+}$ sinks in extraocular muscles. The high mitochondrial content of these muscles may partly reflect this additional function. It is likely that mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ influx increases the dynamic response range of the extraocular muscles and matches metabolic demand to supply.},

abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide and is at present, incurable. The accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide aggregates in AD brain are thought to trigger the extensive synaptic loss and neurodegeneration linked to cognitive decline, an idea that underlies the 'amyloid hypothesis' of AD etiology in both the familal (FAD) and sporadic forms of the disease. Mutations causing FAD also result in the dysregulation of neuronal calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) handling and may contribute to AD pathogenesis, an idea termed the 'calcium hypothesis' of AD. In particular, Ca$^{2+}$ dysregulation by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in AD mouse models results in augmented cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ levels which can trigger signalling cascades that are detrimental to neuronal function and health. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that not all forms of Ca$^{2+}$ dysregulation in AD neurons are harmful and some of them instead may be compensatory. These changes may help modulate neuronal excitability and slow AD pathology, especially in the early stages of the disease. Clearly, a better understanding of how dysregulation of neuronal Ca$^{2+}$ handling contributes to neurodegeneration and neuroprotection in AD is needed as Ca$^{2+}$ signalling modulators are targets of great interest as potential AD therapeutics.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium channels are the primary mediators of depolarization-induced calcium entry into neurons. There is great diversity of calcium channel subtypes due to multiple genes that encode calcium channel $\alpha$1 subunits, coassembly with a variety of ancillary calcium channel subunits, and alternative splicing. This allows these channels to fulfill highly specialized roles in specific neuronal subtypes and at particular subcellular loci. While calcium channels are of critical importance to brain function, their inappropriate expression or dysfunction gives rise to a variety of neurological disorders, including, pain, epilepsy, migraine, and ataxia. This Review discusses salient aspects of voltage-gated calcium channel function, physiology, and pathophysiology.},

The molecular basis for heterodimer formation was investigated by determination of the solution structure of a complex between the survival protein Bcl-xL and the death-promoting region of the Bcl-2-related protein Bak. The structure and binding affinities of mutant Bak peptides indicate that the Bak peptide adopts an amphipathic alpha helix that interacts with Bcl-xL through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.

abstract = {Eukaryotic porins are a group of membrane proteins whose best known role is to form an aqueous pore channel in the mitochondrial outer membrane. As opposed to the bacterial porins (a large family of protein whose 3D structure has been determined by X-ray diffraction), the structure of eukaryotic porins (also termed VDACs, voltage-dependent anion-selective channels) is still a matter of debate. We analysed the secondary structure of VDAC from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fungus Neurospora crassa and the mouse with different types of neural network-based predictors. The predictors were able to discriminate membrane beta-strands, globular alpha-helices and membrane alpha-helices and localised, in all three VDAC sequences, 16 beta-strands along the chain. For all three sequences the N-terminal region showed a high propensity to form a globular alpha-helix. The 16 beta-strand VDAC motif was thus aligned to a bacterial porin-derived template containing a similar 16 beta-strand motif. The alignment of the VDAC sequence with the bacterial porin sequence was used to compute a set of 3D coordinates, which constitutes the first 3D prediction of a eukaryotic porin. All the predicted structures assume a beta-barrel structure composed of 16 beta-strands with the N-terminus outside the membrane. Loops are shorter in this side of the membrane than in the other, where two long loops are protruding. The shape of the pore varies between almost circular for Neurospora and mouse and slightly oval for yeast. Average values between 3 and 2.5 nm at the C-carbon backbone are found for the diameter of the channels. In this model VDAC shows large portions of the structure exposed on both sides of the membrane. The architecture we determine allows speculation about the mechanism of possible interactions between VDAC and other proteins on both sides of the mitochondrial outer membrane. The computed 3D model is consistent with most of the experimental results so far reported.},

abstract = {Ras proteins are binary switches that, by cycling through inactive GDP- and active GTP-bound conformations, regulate multiple cellular signaling pathways, including those that control growth and differentiation. For some time, it has been known that receptor-mediated increases in the concentration of intracellular free calcium ([Ca$^{2+}$](i)) can modulate Ras activation. Increases in [Ca$^{2+}$](i) often occur as repetitive Ca$^{2+}$ spikes or oscillations. Induced by electrical or receptor stimuli, these repetitive Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations increase in frequency with the amplitude of receptor stimuli, a phenomenon critical for the induction of selective cellular functions. Here, we show that Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations are optimized for Ca$^{2+}$-mediated activation of Ras and signaling through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. We present additional evidence that Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations reduce the effective Ca$^{2+}$ threshold for the activation of Ras and that the oscillatory frequency is optimized for activation of Ras and the ERK/MAPK pathway. Our results describe a hitherto unrecognized link between complex Ca$^{2+}$ signals and the modulation of the Ras/ERK/MAPK signaling cascade.},

abstract = {Under conditions of mitochondrial calcium overload, especially when accompanied by oxidative stress, elevated phosphate concentrations and adenine nucleotide depletion, a non-specific pore, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), opens in the inner mitochondrial membrane. MPTP opening enables free passage into the mitochondria of molecules of <1.5 kDa including protons. The resulting uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to ATP depletion and necrotic cell death and it is now widely recognised that MPTP opening is a major cause of reperfusion injury and an effective target for cardioprotection. The properties of the MPTP are well defined, but despite extensive research in many laboratories, its exact molecular identity remains uncertain. Knockout studies have confirmed a role for cyclophilin-D (CyP-D), probably mediated by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity facilitating a conformational change of an inner membrane protein. However, the identity of the membrane component(s) remains controversial. Knockout studies have eliminated an essential role for either the voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC) or the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), although a regulatory role for the ANT was confirmed. Our own studies implicate the mitochondrial phosphate carrier (PiC) in MPTP formation and are consistent with a calcium-triggered conformational change of the PiC, facilitated by CyP-D, inducing pore opening. We propose that this is enhanced by an association of the PiC with the "c" conformation of the ANT. Agents that modulate pore opening may act on either or both the PiC and the ANT. However, knockdown and reconstitution studies are awaited to confirm or refute this model.},

abstract = {The processes of excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes require enormous amounts of energy in the form of ATP, which is produced by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Due to the constantly varying workloads of the heart, efficient matching of energy supply to demand is a requisite for proper heart function. Ca$^{2+}$ is taken up by mitochondria via the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter (MCU) where it stimulates key dehydrogenases of the Krebs cycle to match regeneration of NADH to its oxidation by the respiratory chain. The kinetics of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake, however, remain controversial due to the low Ca$^{2+}$ sensitivity of the MCU. Here, we review the evidence for the existence of a "mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ microdomain", in which the close association of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to mitochondria provides "hot spots" of very high Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations in the vicinity of mitochondria, sufficient to overcome the low Ca$^{2+}$ affinity of the MCU. Mitofusins 1 and 2 play redundant roles in regulating mitochondrial dynamics by controlling fusion of mitochondria with each other. Recent work revealed a unique role for mitofusin 2 in tethering mitochondria to the sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum in various cell types, including cardiac myocytes. Disruption of SR-mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ cross talk in heart failure through spatial and ionic alterations may give rise to energetic deficit and oxidative stress, two factors believed to play causal roles in the progression of the disease. On the other hand, excessive mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake can trigger programmed necrosis, substantiating the ambiguity of the close interplay between these cousin organelles in health and disease.

abstract = {The EF-hand protein with a helix-loop-helix Ca$^{2+}$ binding motif constitutes one of the largest protein families and is involved in numerous biological processes. To facilitate the understanding of the role of Ca$^{2+}$ in biological systems using genomic information, we report, herein, our improvement on the pattern search method for the identification of EF-hand and EF-like Ca$^{2+}$-binding proteins. The canonical EF-hand patterns are modified to cater to different flanking structural elements. In addition, on the basis of the conserved sequence of both the N- and C-terminal EF-hands within S100 and S100-like proteins, a new signature profile has been established to allow for the identification of pseudo EF-hand and S100 proteins from genomic information. The new patterns have a positive predictive value of 99\% and a sensitivity of 96\% for pseudo EF-hands. Furthermore, using the developed patterns, we have identified zero pseudo EF-hand motif and 467 canonical EF-hand Ca$^{2+}$ binding motifs with diverse cellular functions in the bacteria genome. The prediction results imply that pseudo EF-hand motifs are phylogenetically younger than canonical EF-hand motifs. Our prediction of Ca$^{2+}$ binding motifs provides not only an insight into the role of Ca$^{2+}$ and Ca$^{2+}$-binding proteins in bacterial systems, but also a way to explore and define the role of Ca$^{2+}$ in other biological systems (calciomics).},

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease caused by a deficiency in the production of insulin and/or by the effects of insulin resistance. Insulin deficiency leads to hyperglycemia which is the major initiator of diabetic cardiovascular complications escalating with time and driven by many complex biochemical and molecular processes. Four hypotheses, which propose mechanisms of diabetes-associated pathophysiology, are currently considered. Cardiovascular impairment may be caused by an increase in polyol pathway flux, by intracellular advanced glycation end-products formation or increased flux through the hexosamine pathway. The latter of these mechanisms involves activation of the protein kinase C. Cellular and mitochondrial metabolism alterations observed in the course of diabetes are partially associated with an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Among many processes and factors involved in ROS production, the 66 kDa isoform of the growth factor adaptor shc (p66Shc protein) is of particular interest. This protein plays a key role in the control of mitochondria-dependent oxidative balance thus it involvement in diabetic complications and other oxidative stress based pathologies is recently intensively studied. In this review we summarize the current understanding of hyperglycemia induced cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction with an emphasis on the oxidative stress and p66Shc protein.

abstract = {RNA mutational analysis at the secondary-structure level can be useful to a wide-range of biological applications. It can be used to predict an optimal site for performing a nucleotide mutation at the single molecular level, as well as to analyze basic phenomena at the systems level. For the former, as more sequence modification experiments are performed that include site-directed mutagenesis to find and explore functional motifs in RNAs, a pre-processing step that helps guide in planning the experiment becomes vital. For the latter, mutations are generally accepted as a central mechanism by which evolution occurs, and mutational analysis relating to structure should gain a better understanding of system functionality and evolution. In the past several years, the program RNAmute that is structure based and relies on RNA secondary-structure prediction has been developed for assisting in RNA mutational analysis. It has been extended from single-point mutations to treat multiple-point mutations efficiently by initially calculating all suboptimal solutions, after which only the mutations that stabilize the suboptimal solutions and destabilize the optimal one are considered as candidates for being deleterious.

To determine whether energized mitochondria were necessary for wave generation, we blocked mitochondrial function with the electron transport chain inhibitor antimycin A (AA) in combination with oligomycin. AA decreased wave speed and puff probability. These effects were not due to global changes in ATP. We found that AA increased cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$, markedly reduced agonist-evoked inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production, and also enhanced phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding to the Ca$^{2+}$ dependent protein gelsolin. Thus, the reduction in puff probability and wave speed after AA treatment may be explained by competition for PIP2 between phospholipase C and gelsolin. Energized mitochondria and low cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration may be required to maintain PIP2, a substrate for IP3 signal transduction.},

abstract = {Mitochondria possess a sophisticated array of Ca$^{2+}$ transport systems reflecting their key role in physiological Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis. With the exception of most yeast strains, energized organelles are endowed with a very fast and efficient mechanism for Ca$^{2+}$ uptake, the ruthenium red (RR)-sensitive mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter (MCU); and one main mechanism for Ca$^{2+}$ release, the RR-insensitive 3Na(+)-Ca$^{2+}$ antiporter. An additional mechanism for Ca$^{2+}$ release is provided by a Na(+) and RR-insensitive release mechanism, the putative 3H(+)-Ca$^{2+}$ antiporter. A potential kinetic imbalance is present, however, because the V(max) of the MCU is of the order of 1400nmol Ca$^{2+}$mg(-1) proteinmin(-1) while the combined V(max) of the efflux pathways is about 20nmol Ca$^{2+}$mg(-1) proteinmin(-1). This arrangement exposes mitochondria to the hazards of Ca$^{2+}$ overload when the rate of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake exceeds that of the combined efflux pathways, e.g. for sharp increases of cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$]. In this short review we discuss the hypothesis that transient opening of the Ca$^{2+}$-dependent permeability transition pore may provide mitocondria with a fast Ca$^{2+}$ release channel preventing Ca$^{2+}$ overload. We also address the relevance of a mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ release channel recently discovered in Drosophila melanogaster, which possesses intermediate features between the permeability transition pore of yeast and mammals.},

Here, we report a subnanometer resolution electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a fully functional type 1 IP3R from cerebellum in the closed state. The transmembrane region reveals a twisted bundle of four $\alpha$ helices, one from each subunit, that form a funnel shaped structure around the 4-fold symmetry axis, strikingly similar to the ion-conduction pore of K$^+$ channels. The lumenal face of IP3R1 has prominent densities that surround the pore entrance and similar to the highly structured turrets of Kir channels. 3D statistical analysis of the cryo-EM density map identifies high variance in the cytoplasmic region. This structural variation could be attributed to genuine structural flexibility of IP3R1.},

@article{Hoth2000,
abstract = {In addition to their well-known functions in cellular energy transduction, mitochondria play an important role in modulating the amplitude and time course of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals. In many cells, mitochondria act as Ca$^{2+}$ buffers by taking up and releasing Ca$^{2+}$, but this simple buffering action by itself often cannot explain the organelle's effects on Ca$^{2+}$ signaling dynamics. Here we describe the functional interaction of mitochondria with store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ channels in T lymphocytes as a mechanism of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ signaling. In Jurkat T cells with functional mitochondria, prolonged depletion of Ca$^{2+}$ stores causes sustained activation of the store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ current, I(CRAC) (CRAC, Ca$^{2+}$ release-activated Ca$^{2+}$). Inhibition of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by compounds that dissipate the intramitochondrial potential unmasks Ca$^{2+}$-dependent inactivation of I(CRAC). Thus, functional mitochondria are required to maintain CRAC-channel activity, most likely by preventing local Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation near sites that govern channel inactivation. In cells stimulated through the T-cell antigen receptor, acute blockade of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake inhibits the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFAT in parallel with CRAC channel activity and [Ca$^{2+}$](i) elevation, indicating a functional link between mitochondrial regulation of I(CRAC) and T-cell activation. These results demonstrate a role for mitochondria in controlling Ca$^{2+}$ channel activity and signal transmission from the plasma membrane to the nucleus.},

abstract = {There is a significant number of data confirming that the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in a living cell is a complex, multiregulated process. Calcium efflux from excitable cells (i.e., neurons) occurs through two main systems--an electrochemically driven Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger with a low Ca$^{2+}$ affinity (K0.5 = 10-15 microM), and a plasmalemmal, specific Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase, with a high Ca$^{2+}$ affinity (K0.5 < 0.5-1 microM), whereas in nonexcitable cells (i.e., erythrocytes) the calcium pump is the sole system responsible for the extrusion of calcium ions. The plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase (PMCA) is a ubiquitously expressed protein, and more than 26 transcripts of four PMCA genes are distributed in a tissue specific manner. Differences in the structure and localization of PMCA variants are thought to correlate with specific regulatory properties and may have consequences for proper cellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling. The regulatory mechanisms of calcium pump activity have been studied extensively, resulting in a new view of the functioning of this important molecule in the membranes.},

New investigators entering the field are often confounded by the VDAC literature and its many apparent conflicts and contradictions. This review is an effort to shed light on the situation and identify reliable information from more questionable claims. Our views on the most important controversial issues are as follows: VDAC is only present in the mitochondrial outer membrane. VDAC functions as a monomer. VDAC functions normally with or without Ca$^{2+}$. It does not form channels that mediate the flux of proteins through membranes (peptides and unfolded proteins are excluded from this statement). Closure of VDAC, not VDAC opening, leads to mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization and apoptosis.},

@article{Moreau2006,
abstract = {A rise in cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration is used as a key activation signal in virtually all animal cells, where it triggers a range of responses including neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and cell growth and proliferation [1]. During intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling, mitochondria rapidly take up significant amounts of Ca$^{2+}$ from the cytosol, and this stimulates energy production, alters the spatial and temporal profile of the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signal, and triggers cell death [2-10]. Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake occurs via a ruthenium-red-sensitive uniporter channel found in the inner membrane [11]. In spite of its critical importance, little is known about how the uniporter is regulated. Here, we report that the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter is gated by cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Ca$^{2+}$ uptake into mitochondria is a Ca$^{2+}$-activated process with a requirement for functional calmodulin. However, cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ subsequently inactivates the uniporter, preventing further Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. The uptake pathway and the inactivation process have relatively low Ca$^{2+}$ affinities of approximately 10-20 microM. However, numerous mitochondria are within 20-100 nm of the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby enabling rapid and efficient transmission of Ca$^{2+}$ release into adjacent mitochondria by InsP(3) receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum. Hence, biphasic control of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by Ca$^{2+}$ provides a novel basis for complex physiological patterns of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling.},

abstract = {Traditional mutation assessment methods generally focus on predicting disruptive changes in protein-coding regions rather than non-coding regulatory regions like untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. The UTRs, however, are known to have many sequence and structural motifs that can regulate translational and transcriptional efficiency and stability of mRNAs through interaction with RNA-binding proteins and other non-coding RNAs like microRNAs (miRNAs). In a recent study, transcriptomes of tumor cells harboring mutant and wild-type KRAS (V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) genes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been sequenced to identify single nucleotide variations (SNVs). About 40\% of the total SNVs (73,717) identified were mapped to UTRs, but omitted in the previous analysis. To meet this obvious demand for analysis of the UTRs, we designed a comprehensive pipeline to predict the effect of SNVs on two major regulatory elements, secondary structure and miRNA target sites. Out of 29,290 SNVs in 6462 genes, we predict 472 SNVs (in 408 genes) affecting local RNA secondary structure, 490 SNVs (in 447 genes) affecting miRNA target sites and 48 that do both. Together these disruptive SNVs were present in 803 different genes, out of which 188 (23.4\%) were previously known to be cancer-associated. Notably, this ratio is significantly higher (one-sided Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.032) than the ratio (20.8\%) of known cancer-associated genes (n = 1347) in our initial data set (n = 6462). Network analysis shows that the genes harboring disruptive SNVs were involved in molecular mechanisms of cancer, and the signaling pathways of LPS-stimulated MAPK, IL-6, iNOS, EIF2 and mTOR. In conclusion, we have found hundreds of SNVs which are highly disruptive with respect to changes in the secondary structure and miRNA target sites within UTRs. These changes hold the potential to alter the expression of known cancer genes or genes linked to cancer-associated pathways.},

@article{Shkreta2011,
abstract = {Alternative splicing often produces effectors with opposite functions in apoptosis. Splicing decisions must therefore be tightly connected to stresses, stimuli, and pathways that control cell survival and cell growth. We have shown previously that PKC signaling prevents the production of proapoptotic Bcl-x(S) to favor the accumulation of the larger antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L) splice variant in 293 cells. Here we show that the genotoxic stress induced by oxaliplatin elicits an ATM-, CHK2-, and p53-dependent splicing switch that favors the production of the proapoptotic Bcl-x(S) variant. This DNA damage-induced splicing shift requires the activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Interestingly, the ATM/CHK2/p53/tyrosine phosphatases pathway activated by oxaliplatin regulates Bcl-x splicing through the same regulatory sequence element (SB1) that receives signals from the PKC pathway. Convergence of the PKC and DNA damage signaling routes may control the abundance of a key splicing repressor because SB1-mediated repression is lost when protein synthesis is impaired but is rescued by blocking proteasome-mediated protein degradation. The SB1 splicing regulatory module therefore receives antagonistic signals from the PKC and the p53-dependent DNA damage response pathways to control the balance of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-x splice variants.},

J. 56: 229-242, 1989), including the influence of Ca$^{2+}$ handling by the mitochondria. Our minimal model of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling [G. Magnus and J. Keizer. Am. J. Physiol. 273 (Cell Physiol. 42): C717-C733, 1997] is expanded to include the D-glucose dependence of the rate of production of mitochondrial reducing equivalents. The Ca$^{2+}$ dependence of the mitochondrial dehydrogenases, which is also included in the model, plays only a small role in the simulations, since the dehydrogenases appear to be maximally activated when D-glucose concentrations are sufficient to produce bursting. A previous model of ionic currents in the plasma membrane is updated using a recent experimental characterization of the dependence of the conductance of the ATP-sensitive K$^+$ (KATP) current on adenine nucleotides. The resulting whole cell model is complex, involving 12 dynamic variables that couple Ca$^{2+}$ handling in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria with electrical activity in the plasma and inner mitochondrial membranes. Simulations with the whole cell model give rise to bursting electrical activity similar to that seen in pancreatic islets and clusters of pancreatic beta-cells. The full D-glucose dose response of electrical activity is obtained if the cytosolic rate of ATP hydrolysis is a sigmoidal function of glucose. The simulations give the correct shape, period, and phase of the associated oscillations in cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$, predict that the conductance of the KATP current oscillates out of phase with electrical activity [as recently observed in ob/ob mice (O. Larsson, H. Kindmark, R. Br\"{a}nstrom, B. Fredholm, and P.-O. Berggren. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 5161-5165, 1996)], and make other novel predictions. In this model, bursting results because Ca$^{2+}$ uptake into mitochondria during the active phase reduces the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, reducing the rate of production of ATP, which in turn activates the KATP current and repolarizes the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {The structure of RiboNucleic Acid (RNA) has the potential to be altered by a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP). Disease-associated SNPs mapping to non-coding regions of the genome that are transcribed into RiboNucleic Acid (RNA) can potentially affect cellular regulation (and cause disease) by altering the structure of the transcript. We performed a large-scale meta-analysis of Selective 2'-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) data, which probes the structure of RNA. We found that several single point mutations exist that significantly disrupt RNA secondary structure in the five transcripts we analyzed. Thus, every RNA that is transcribed has the potential to be a "RiboSNitch;" where a SNP causes a large conformational change that alters regulatory function. Predicting the SNPs that will have the largest effect on RNA structure remains a contemporary computational challenge. We therefore benchmarked the most popular RNA structure prediction algorithms for their ability to identify mutations that maximally affect structure. We also evaluated metrics for rank ordering the extent of the structural change. Although no single algorithm/metric combination dramatically outperformed the others, small differences in AUC (Area Under the Curve) values reveal that certain approaches do provide better agreement with experiment. The experimental data we analyzed nonetheless show that multiple single point mutations exist in all RNA transcripts that significantly disrupt structure in agreement with the predictions.},

abstract = {To visualize Ca$^{2+}$-dependent protein-protein interactions in living cells by fluorescence readouts, we used a circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP), in which the amino and carboxyl portions had been interchanged and reconnected by a short spacer between the original termini. The cpGFP was fused to calmodulin and its target peptide, M13. The chimeric protein, which we have named "pericam," was fluorescent and its spectral properties changed reversibly with the amount of Ca$^{2+}$, probably because of the interaction between calmodulin and M13 leading to an alteration of the environment surrounding the chromophore. Three types of pericam were obtained by mutating several amino acids adjacent to the chromophore. Of these, "flash-pericam" became brighter with Ca$^{2+}$, whereas "inverse-pericam" dimmed. On the other hand, "ratiometric-pericam" had an excitation wavelength changing in a Ca$^{2+}$-dependent manner. All of the pericams expressed in HeLa cells were able to monitor free Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics, such as Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in the cytosol and the nucleus. Ca$^{2+}$ imaging using high-speed confocal line-scanning microscopy and a flash-pericam allowed to detect the free propagation of Ca$^{2+}$ ions across the nuclear envelope. Then, free Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations in the nucleus and mitochondria were simultaneously measured by using ratiometric-pericams having appropriate localization signals, revealing that extra-mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transients caused rapid changes in the concentration of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$. Finally, a "split-pericam" was made by deleting the linker in the flash-pericam. The Ca$^{2+}$-dependent interaction between calmodulin and M13 in HeLa cells was monitored by the association of the two halves of GFP, neither of which was fluorescent by itself.},

abstract = {We previously reported that uncoupling Ca2(+)-loaded mitochondria in the presence of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) produces a partial expression of the permeability transition. From this and related observations, it was proposed that the absence of external free Ca$^{2+}$ is inhibitory to reverse activity of the Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter (Igbavboa, U., and Pfeiffer, D.R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1405-1412). By using Sr2(+)-instead of Ca2(+)-loaded mitochondria, the transition is avoided upon treatment with EGTA plus uncoupler, and inhibition of reverse uniport activity can be observed directly. In the presence of physiological Mg2+ concentrations, reverse uniport of Sr2+ is eliminated by external EGTA following a brief period of rapid activity. It is proposed that binding of Mg2+ rather than Sr2+ (Ca$^{2+}$) at an external site is responsible for the inhibition. Regulation at the external site is modified by the size of the Sr2+ load. EGTA, in the presence of Mg2+, does not inhibit the reverse uniport-dependent release of Sr2+ from mitoplasts. The inhibitory effect can be recovered by adding back the soluble components obtained as the intermembrane space fraction following removal of the outer membrane. The soluble factor could be a regulatory subunit which contains the external cation binding site. Adjustments to uniporter activity due to regulation by the binding site and/or the soluble factor may be slow and may be significant in determining how mitochondria respond to rapid Ca$^{2+}$ transients in vivo.},

There are no large channels leading from the cytoplasmic surface to the pair of high-affinity Ca$^{2+}$ binding sites within the transmembrane region. One possible access pathway involves the charged residues in transmembrane alpha-helix M1, with a Ca$^{2+}$ ion passing through the first site to reach the second site. The Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase also contains a pair of binding sites for Ca$^{2+}$ that are exposed to the lumen. In the four-site model for transport, phosphorylation of the ATPase leads to transfer of the two bound Ca$^{2+}$ ions from the cytoplasmic to the lumenal pair of sites. In the alternating four-site model for transport, phosphorylation leads to release of the bound Ca$^{2+}$ ions directly from the cytoplasmic pair of sites, linked to closure of the pair of lumenal binding sites. The lumenal pair of sites could involve a cluster of conserved acidic residues in the loop between M1 and M2. Since there is no obvious pathway from the high-affinity sites to the lumenal surface of the membrane, transport of Ca$^{2+}$ ions must involve a significant change in the packing of the transmembrane alpha-helices. The link between the phosphorylation domain and the pair of high-affinity Ca$^{2+}$ binding sites is probably provided by two small helices, P1 and P2, in the phosphorylation domain, which contact the loop between transmembrane alpha-helices M6 and M7.},

abstract = {Abstract The role of Ca 2+ as a key and pivotal second messenger in cells depends largely on a wide number of heterogeneous so-called calcium binding proteins (CBP), which have the ability to bind this ion in specifi c domains. CBP contribute to the control of Ca 2+ concentration in the cytosol and participate in numerous cel- lular functions by acting as Ca 2+ transporters across cell membranes or as Ca 2+ - modulated sensors, i.e., decoding Ca 2+ signals. In this chapter we review the main Ca 2+ -modulated CBP, starting with those intracellular CBP that contain the struc- tural EF-hand domain: parvalbumin, calmodulin, S100 proteins and calcineurin. Then, we address intracellular CBP lacking the EF-hand domain: CBP within intra- cellular Ca 2+ stores (paying special attention to calreticulin and calsequestrin), annexins and proteins that contain a C2 domain, such as protein kinase C (PKC) or sinaptotagmin. Finally, extracellular CBP have been classifi ed in six groups, accord- ing to their Ca 2+ binding structures: (i) EF-hand domains; (ii) EGF-like domains; (iii) g -carboxyl glutamic acid (GLA)-rich domains; (iv) cadherin domains; (v) Ca 2+ - dependent (C)-type lectin-like domains; (vi) Ca 2+ -binding pockets of family C G-protein-coupled receptors. For all proteins, we briefl y review their structure, location and function and additionally their potential as pharmacological targets in several human diseases.},

@article{Maeda1999,
abstract = {The periodontal ligament receives a rich sensory nerve supply and contains many nociceptors and mechanoreceptors. Although its various kinds of mechanoreceptors have been reported in the past, only recently have studies revealed that the Ruffini endings--categorized as low-threshold, slowly adapting, type II mechanoreceptors--are the primary mechanoreceptors in the periodontal ligament. The periodontal Ruffini endings display dendritic ramifications with expanded terminal buttons and, furthermore, are ultrastructurally characterized by expanded axon terminals filled with many mitochondria and by an association with terminal or lamellar Schwann cells. The axon terminals of the periodontal Ruffini endings have finger-like projections called axonal spines or microspikes, which extend into the surrounding tissue to detect the deformation of collagen fibers. The functional basis of the periodontal Ruffini endings has been analyzed by histochemical techniques. Histochemically, the axon terminals are reactive for cytochrome oxidase activity, and the terminal Schwann cells have both non-specific cholinesterase and acid phosphatase activity. On the other hand, many investigations have suggested that the Ruffini endings have a high potential for neuroplasticity. For example, immunoreactivity for p75-NGFR (low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) and GAP-43 (growth-associated protein-43), both of which play important roles in nerve regeneration/development processes, have been reported in the periodontal Ruffini endings, even in adult animals (though these proteins are usually repressed or down-regulated in mature neurons). Furthermore, in experimental studies on nerve injury to the inferior alveolar nerve, the degeneration of Ruffini endings takes place immediately after nerve injury, with regeneration beginning from 3 to 5 days later, and the distribution and terminal morphology returning to almost normal at around 14 days. During regeneration, some regenerating Ruffini endings expressed neuropeptide Y, which is rarely observed in normal animals. On the other hand, the periodontal Ruffini endings show stage-specific configurations which are closely related to tooth eruption and the addition of occlusal forces to the tooth during postnatal development, suggesting that mechanical stimuli due to tooth eruption and occlusion are a prerequisite for the differentiation and maturation of the periodontal Ruffini endings. Further investigations are needed to clarify the involvement of growth factors in the molecular mechanisms of the development and regeneration processes of the Ruffini endings.},

This model is coupled to equations describing Ca$^{2+}$, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), ATP, and Na$^+$ homeostasis, including the uptake and release of Ca$^{2+}$ by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In our model, metabolically derived ATP activates inward Ca$^{2+}$ flux by regulation of ATP-sensitive K$^+$ channels and depolarization of the plasma membrane. Results from the simulations support the hypothesis that intracellular Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ in the ER can be the main variables driving both fast (2-7 osc/min) and slow intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration oscillations (0.3-0.9 osc/min) and that the effect of IP3 on Ca$^{2+}$ leak from the ER contributes to the pattern of slow calcium oscillations. Simulations also show that filling the ER Ca$^{2+}$ stores leads to faster electrical bursting and Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. Specific Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in isolated beta-cell lines can also be simulated.},

abstract = {Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP(3)Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are tetrameric intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ channels. In each of these receptor families, the pore, which is formed by carboxy-terminal transmembrane domains, is regulated by signals that are detected by large cytosolic structures. InsP(3)R gating is initiated by InsP(3) binding to the InsP(3)-binding core (IBC, residues 224-604 of InsP(3)R1) and it requires the suppressor domain (SD, residues 1-223 of InsP(3)R1). Here we present structures of the amino-terminal region (NT, residues 1-604) of rat InsP(3)R1 with (3.6 \AA) and without (3.0 \AA) InsP(3) bound. The arrangement of the three NT domains, SD, IBC-$\beta$ and IBC-$\alpha$, identifies two discrete interfaces ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) between the IBC and SD. Similar interfaces occur between equivalent domains (A, B and C) in RyR1 (ref. 9). The orientations of the three domains when docked into a tetrameric structure of InsP(3)R and of the ABC domains docked into RyR are remarkably similar. The importance of the $\alpha$-interface for activation of InsP(3)R and RyR is confirmed by mutagenesis and, for RyR, by disease-causing mutations. Binding of InsP(3) causes partial closure of the clam-like IBC, disrupting the $\beta$-interface and pulling the SD towards the IBC. This reorients an exposed SD loop ('hotspot' (HS) loop) that is essential for InsP(3)R activation. The loop is conserved in RyR and includes mutations that are associated with malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. The HS loop interacts with an adjacent NT, suggesting that activation re-arranges inter-subunit interactions. The A domain of RyR functionally replaced the SD in full-length InsP(3)R, and an InsP(3)R in which its C-terminal transmembrane region was replaced by that from RyR1 was gated by InsP(3) and blocked by ryanodine. Activation mechanisms are conserved between InsP(3)R and RyR. Allosteric modulation of two similar domain interfaces within an N-terminal subunit reorients the first domain (SD or A domain), allowing it, through interactions of the second domain of an adjacent subunit (IBC-$\beta$ or B domain), to gate the pore.},

In this module, attention is focused on the On mechanisms responsible for transmitting information into the cell. These signalling pathways fall into two main groups depending on how they are activated. Most of them are activated by external stimuli and function to transfer information from the cell surface to internal effector systems. However, some of the signalling systems respond to information generated from within the cell, usually in the form of metabolic messengers . For all of these signalling pathways, information is conveyed either through protein–protein interactions or it is transmitted by diffusible elements usually referred to as second messengers. Cells often employ a number of these signalling pathways, and cross-talk between them is an important feature. In this section, attention is focused on the properties of the major intracellular signalling pathways operating in cells to regulate their cellular activity.},

@article{Inohara1998,
abstract = {We have identified and characterized Diva, which is a novel regulator of apoptosis. Sequence analysis revealed that Diva is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins containing Bcl-2 homology domain 1, 2, 3, and 4 (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4) regions and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain. The expression of Diva mRNA was detected in multiple embryonic tissues but was restricted to the ovary and testis in adult mice. The expression of Diva promoted the death of 293T, Ramsey, and T47D cells as well as that of primary sensory neurons, indicating that Diva is a proapoptotic protein. Significantly, Diva lacks critical residues in the conserved BH3 region that mediate the interaction between BH3-containing proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues and their prosurvival binding partners. Consistent with this, Diva did not bind to cellular Bcl-2 family members including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1/Bfl-1. Furthermore, mutants of Diva lacking the BH3 region fully retained their proapoptotic activity, confirming that Diva promotes apoptosis in a BH3-independent manner. Significantly, Diva interacted with a viral Bcl-2 homologue (vBcl-2) encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Consistent with these associations, apoptosis induced by Diva was inhibited by vBcl-2 but not by Bcl-XL. Importantly, Diva interacted with Apaf-1, an adapter molecule that activates caspase-9, a central death protease of the apoptotic pathway. The expression of Diva inhibited the binding of Bcl-XL to Apaf-1, as determined by immunoprecipitation assays. Thus, Diva represents a novel type of proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologue that promotes apoptosis independently of the BH3 region through direct binding to Apaf-1, thus preventing Bcl-XL from binding to the caspase-9 regulator Apaf-1.},

@article{Petersen1995,
abstract = {A few years ago, my laboratory obtained evidence for local agonist-evoked repetitive Ca$^{2+}$ spikes in single pancreatic acinar cells. We have now confirmed this and shown that regular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ spikes evoked by low concentrations of acetylcholine or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) are confined to the secretory granule area at the luminal pole of the cells. The local subcellular signals probably arise because the first internal messenger (InsP3), generated from the basolateral membrane, can diffuse rapidly, whereas the Ca$^{2+}$ released from the more responsive secretory granule region has a very restricted mobility. Local Ca$^{2+}$ spikes are useful from an energetic point of view and also help to avoid undesirable activation of Ca$^{2+}$-dependent processes. Another messenger, cyclic ADP-ribose, may also regulate intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ release. In pancreatic acinar cells cyclic ADP-ribose induces repetitive Ca$^{2+}$ spikes localized in the secretory granule area; these spikes are blocked by ryanodine, but also by the InsP3 receptor antagonist heparin. Ryanodine abolishes or markedly inhibits agonist-evoked Ca$^{2+}$ spiking, but enhances the frequency of spikes evoked by internal InsP3 application. These results indicate that both ryanodine and InsP3 receptors are involved in Ca$^{2+}$ spike generation in pancreatic acinar cells, and that both InsP3 and cyclic ADP-ribose may act as internal messengers.},

@article{Swann2008,
abstract = {It has been known for some time that mammalian eggs are activated by a series of intracellular calcium oscillations that occur shortly after sperm egg membrane fusion. Recent work has identified a novel sperm specific phospholipase C zeta as the likely agent that stimulates the calcium oscillations in eggs after sperm-egg membrane fusion. PLCzeta is stimulated by low intracellular calcium levels in a manner which suggests that there is a regenerative feedback of calcium release and PLCzeta induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate (InsP3) production in eggs. This implies calcium oscillations in fertilizing mammalian eggs are driven by underlying oscillations of InsP3. This model of oscillations is supported by the response of mouse eggs to sudden increases in InsP3. The cellular targets of calcium oscillations include calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, protein kinase C and mitochondria. There is evidence that eggs might be best activated by multiple calcium increases rather than a single calcium rise. As yet we do not fully understand how the target of calcium in a mammalian egg might decode the patterns of calcium changes that can occur during egg activation.},

@article{McDonough1996,
abstract = {Inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels by omega-conotoxin MVIIC (omega-CTx-MVIIC) was studied in various types of rat neurons. When studied with 5 mM Ba2+ as charge carrier, omega-CTx-MVIIC block of N-type calcium channels in sympathetic neurons was potent, with half-block at 18 nM. Block of N-type channels had a rapid onset (tau approximately 1 sec at 1 microM omega-CTx-MVIIC) and quick reversibility (tau approximately 30 sec). The rate of block was proportional to toxin concentration, consistent with 1:1 binding of toxin to channels, with a rate constant (k on) of approximately 1 X 10(6) M-1. sec-1. Both potency and rate of block were reduced dramatically with increasing concentrations of extracellular Ba2+ omega-CTx-MVIIC also blocked P-type calcium channels in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, but both development and reversal of block were far slower than for N-type channels. The rate of block was proportional to toxin concentration, with k on -1.5 x 10(3) M-1. sec-1 at 5 mM Ba2+. From this value and an unblocking time constant of approximately 200 min, a dissociation constant of approximately 50 nM was estimated. Thus, block of P-type channels is potent but very slow. In hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons, omega-CTx-MVIIC blocked approximately 50\% of the high-threshold calcium channel current; one component (approximately 20\%) was blocked with the rapid kinetics expected for N-type channels, whereas the other component was blocked slowly. The component blocked slowly was reduced but not eliminated by preexposure to 200 nM or 1 microM omega-Aga-IVA.},

abstract = {We have analyzed voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) gating on the assumption that the states occupied by the channel are determined mainly by their electrostatic energy. The voltage dependence of VDAC gating both in the presence and in the absence of a salt activity gradient was explained just by invoking electrostatic interactions. A model describing this energy in the main VDAC states has been developed. On the basis of the model, we have considered how external factors cause the redistribution of the channels among their conformational states. We propose that there is a difference in the electrostatic interaction between the voltage sensor and fixed charge within the channel when the former is located in the cis side of membrane as opposed to the trans. This could be the main cause of the shift in the probability curve. The theory describes satisfactorily the experimental data (Zizi et al., Biophys. J. 1998. 75:704-713) and explains some peculiarities of VDAC gating. The asymmetry of the probability curve was related to the apparent location of the VDAC voltage sensor in the open state. By analyzing published experimental data, we concluded that this apparent location is influenced by the diffusion potential. Also discussed is the possibility that VDAC gating at high voltage may be better described by assuming that the mobile charge consists of two parts that have to overcome different energetic barriers in the channel-closing process.},

abstract = {Fast Ca$^{2+}$ uptake into K$^+$-depolarized cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells has been isotopically measured in a time scale of 1-10 s. Depolarized cells retained as much as 80-fold 45Ca$^{2+}$ taken up by resting cells; Ca$^{2+}$ was not taken up by fibroblasts or endothelial-like cells. Because Ca$^{2+}$ entry was inhibited by inorganic (La3+, Co2+, Mg2+) and organic (nifedipine) Ca$^{2+}$ channel antagonists and enhanced by the Ca$^{2+}$ channel activator Bay-K-8644, it seems clear that Ca$^{2+}$ gains access to the chromaffin cell cytosol mainly through specific voltage-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ channels. Ca$^{2+}$ uptake evoked by 59 mM K$^+$ was linear during the first 5 s of stimulation and continued to rise at a much slower rate up to 60 s. The rate of Ca$^{2+}$ entry became steeper as the external [Ca$^{2+}$] increased; initial rates of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake varied from 0.06 fmol/cells . s at 0.125 mM Ca$^{2+}$ to 2.85 fmol/cell . s at 7.5 mM Ca$^{2+}$. The early 90Sr2+ uptake was linear but faster than Ca$^{2+}$ uptake and later on was also saturated; 133Ba2+ was taken up still at a much faster rate and was linear for the entire depolarization period (2-60 s). Increased [K$^+$] gradually depolarized chromaffin cells; Ca$^{2+}$ and Sr2+ uptakes were not apparent below 30 mM K$^+$ but were linear for 30 to 60 mM K$^+$. In contrast, substantial Ba2+ uptake was seen even in K$^+$-free solutions; and in 5.9 mM K$^+$, Ba2+ uptake was as high as Ca$^{2+}$ uptake obtained in 60 mM K$^+$. Five to ten-second pulses of 45Ca$^{2+}$, 90Sr2+, or 133Ba2+ given at different times after pre-depolarization of chromaffin cells served to analyze the kinetics of inactivation of the rates of entry of each divalent cation. Inactivation of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake was faster than Sr2+, and Ba2+ uptake inactivated very little. Neither voltage changes nor Ca$^{2+}$ ions passing through the channels seems to cause their inactivation; however, experiments aimed to manipulate the levels of internal Ca$^{2+}$ using the cell-permeable chelator Quin-2 or the ionophore A23187 strongly suggest that intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ levels determine the rates of inactivation of these channels.},

abstract = {Intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations are observed in a large number of non-excitable cells. While most appear to reflect an intermittent Ca$^{2+}$ release from intracellular stores, in some instances intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations strongly depend on Ca$^{2+}$ influx, and are coupled to oscillations of the membrane potential, suggesting that a plasma membrane-based mechanism may be involved. We have developed a theoretical model for the latter type of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations based on the Ca$^{2+}$-dependent modulation of the intermediate-conductance, Ca$^{2+}$-activated K$^+$ (IKCa) channel. The functioning of this model relies on the Ca$^{2+}$-dependent activation, and the much slower Ca$^{2+}$-dependent rundown of this channel. We have shown that Ca$^{2+}$-dependent activation of the IKCa channels, the consequent membrane hyperpolarization and the resulting increase in Ca$^{2+}$ influx may confer the positive feedback mechanism required for the ascending phase of the oscillation. The much slower Ca$^{2+}$-dependent rundown process will conversely halt this positive loop, and establish the descending phase of the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillation. We found that this simple model gives rise to intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations when using physiologically reasonable parameters, suggesting that IKCa channels could participate in the generation of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations.},

It is well known that Ca$^{2+}$ regulates numerous physiological cellular phenomena as a second messenger as well as triggering pathological events such as cell injury and death. A number of methods have been developed to measure intracellular Ca$^{2+}$. In this review, we summarize the advantages and pitfalls of a variety of Ca$^{2+}$ indicators used in both optical and nonoptical techniques employed for measuring intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration.},

abstract = {The existence of the bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) gene was reported nearly 30 years ago. Yet, Bcl-2 family group of proteins still surprises us with their structural and functional diversity. Since the discovery of the Bcl-2 family of proteins as one of the main apoptosis judges, the precise mechanism of their action remains a hot topic of intensive scientific research and debates. Although extensive work has been performed on the role of mitochondria in apoptosis, more and more studies point out an implication of the endoplasmic reticulum in this process. Interestingly, Bcl-2 family proteins could be localized to both the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum highlighting their crucial role in apoptosis control. In particular, in these organelles Bcl-2 proteins seem to be involved in calcium homeostasis regulation although the mechanisms underlying this function are still misunderstood. We now assume with high degree of certainty that the majority of Bcl-2 family members take part not only in apoptosis regulation but also in other processes important for the cell physiology briefly denominated as "non-apoptotic" functions. Drawing a complete and comprehensive image of Bcl-2 family requires the understanding of their implications in all cellular processes. Here, we review the current knowledge on the control of calcium homeostasis by the Bcl-2 family at the endoplasmic reticulum and at the mitochondria. Then we focus on the non-apoptotic functions of the Bcl-2 proteins in relation with the regulation of this versatile intracellular messenger. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 12th European Symposium on Calcium.},

abstract = {We have cloned cDNAs encoding the rabbit and human forms of the Ca$^{2+}$ release channel of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 5032 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 563,584, which is made without an NH2-terminal signal sequence. Amino acid substitutions between rabbit and human sequences were noted in 163 positions and deletions or insertions in eight regions accounted for additional sequence differences between the two proteins. Analysis of the sequence indicates that 10 potential transmembrane sequences in the COOH-terminal fifth of the molecule and two additional, potential transmembrane sequences nearer to the center of the molecule could contribute to the formation of the Ca$^{2+}$ conducting pore. The remainder of the molecule is hydrophilic and presumably constitutes the cytoplasmic domain of the protein. A 114-120 amino acid motif is repeated four times in the protein, in residues 841-954, 955-1068, 2725-2844, and 2845-2958 and a 16 amino acid part of the motif is repeated twice more in residues 1344-1359 and 1371-1386. Although the channel is modulated by Ca$^{2+}$, ATP, and calmodulin, no clear high affinity Ca2(+)-binding domain of the EF hand type and no clear high affinity ATP-binding domain were detected in the primary sequence. An acidic sequence in residues 1872-1923 contains 79\% glutamate or aspartate residues and this sequence is a potential low affinity Ca2(+)-binding site. Several potential calmodulin-binding sites were observed in the sequence, in the region 2800 to 3050.},

Thanks to a GFP-based Ca$^{2+}$ probe localized on the cytosolic surface of the outer mitochondrial membrane, we demonstrate that, upon Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization, the [Ca$^{2+}$] in small regions of the mitochondrial surface reaches levels 5- to 10-fold higher than in the bulk cytosol. We also show that the [Ca$^{2+}$] to which mitochondria are exposed during capacitative Ca$^{2+}$ influx is similar between near plasma membrane mitochondria and organelles deeply located in the cytoplasm, whereas it is 2- to 3-fold higher in subplasma membrane mitochondria upon activation of voltage-gated Ca$^{2+}$ channels. These results demonstrate that mitochondria are exposed to Ca$^{2+}$ hot spots close to the ER but are excluded from the regions where capacitative Ca$^{2+}$ influx occurs.},

The egl-1 gene negatively regulates the ced-9 gene, which protects against cell death and is a member of the bcl-2 family. The EGL-1 protein contains a nine amino acid region similar to the Bcl-2 homology region 3 (BH3) domain but does not contain a BH1, BH2, or BH4 domain, suggesting that EGL-1 may be a member of a family of cell death activators that includes the mammalian proteins Bik, Bid, Harakiri, and Bad. The EGL-1 and CED-9 proteins interact physically. We propose that EGL-1 activates programmed cell death by binding to and directly inhibiting the activity of CED-9, perhaps by releasing the cell death activator CED-4 from a CED-9/CED-4-containing protein complex.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To review recent findings concerning Ca$^{2+}$ channel subtype/structure/function from electrophysiological and molecular biological studies and to explain Ca$^{2+}$ channel diseases and the actions of anesthetics on Ca$^{2+}$ channels. SOURCE: The information was obtained from articles published recently and from our published work. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Voltage-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ channels serve as one of the important mechanisms for Ca$^{2+}$ influx into the cells, enabling the regulation of intracellular concentration of free Ca$^{2+}$. Recent advances both in electrophysiology and in molecular biology have made it possible to observe channel activity directly and to investigate channel functions at molecular levels. The Ca$^{2+}$ channel can be divided into subtypes according to electrophysiological characteristics, and each subtype has its own gene. The L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel is the target of a large number of clinically important drugs, especially dihydropyridines, and binding sites of Ca$^{2+}$ antagonists have been clarified. The effects of various kinds of anesthetics in a variety of cell types have been demonstrated, and some clinical effects of anesthetics can be explained by the effects on Ca$^{2+}$ channels. It has recently become apparent that some hereditary diseases such as hypokalemic periodic paralysis result from calcium channelopathies. CONCLUSION: Recent advances both in electrophysiology and in molecular biology have made it possible to clarify the Ca$^{2+}$ channel structures, functions, genes, and the anesthetic actions on the channels in detail. The effects of anesthetics on the Ca$^{2+}$ channels either of patients with hereditary channelopathies or using gene mutation techniques are left to be discovered.},

Mutations in RyRs have been linked to several human diseases. Mutations in the cardiac isoform of RyR2 are associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias (CPVT), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2), whereas mutations in the skeletal muscle isoform (RyR1) are linked to malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD). RyRs are modulated by several other proteins, including the FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. These immunophilins appear to stabilize a closed state of the channel and are important for cooperative interactions among the subunits of RyRs. This review discusses the regulation of RyRs by FKBPs and the possibility that defective modulation of RyR2 by FKBP12.6 could play a role in heart failure, CPVT, and ARVD2. Also discussed are the consequences of FKBP12 depletion to skeletal muscle and the possibility of FKBP12 involvement in certain forms of MH or CCD.},

abstract = {The free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration within the mitochondrial matrix ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) regulates the rate of ATP production and other [Ca$^{2+}$]m sensitive processes. It is set by the balance between total Ca$^{2+}$ influx (through the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter (MCU) and any other influx pathways) and the total Ca$^{2+}$ efflux (by the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger and any other efflux pathways). Here we review and analyze the experimental evidence reported over the past 40years which suggest that in the heart and many other mammalian tissues a putative Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger is the major pathway for Ca$^{2+}$ efflux from the mitochondrial matrix. We discuss those reports with respect to a recent discovery that the protein product of the human FLJ22233 gene mediates such Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Among its many functional similarities to other Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger proteins is a unique feature: it efficiently mediates Li(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange (as well as Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange) and was therefore named NCLX. The discovery of NCLX provides both the identity of a novel protein and new molecular means of studying various unresolved quantitative aspects of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ movement out of the matrix. Quantitative and qualitative features of NCLX are discussed as is the controversy regarding the stoichiometry of the NCLX Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange, the electrogenicity of NCLX, the [Na(+)]i dependency of NCLX and the magnitude of NCLX Ca$^{2+}$ efflux. Metabolic features attributable to NCLX and the physiological implication of the Ca$^{2+}$ efflux rate via NCLX during systole and diastole are also briefly discussed.},

This model was previously proposed for the study of the physiological role of mitochondria and the cytosolic proteins in gene rating complex Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations [1]. Here, we investigated the occurrence of different types of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations obtained by the model, i.e. simple oscillations, bursting, and chaos. In a bifurcation diagram, we have shown that all these various modes of oscillatory behavior are obtained by a change of only one model parameter, which corresponds to the physiological variability of an agonist. Bursting oscillations were studied in more detail because they express birhythmicity, trirhythmicity and chaotic behavior. Two different routes to chaos are observed in the model: in addition to the usual period doubling cascade, we also show intermittency. For the characterization of the chaotic behavior, we made use of return maps and Lyapunov exponents. The potential biological role of chaos in intracellular signaling is discussed.},

A steady-state Ca$^{2+}$ concentration of approximately 630 microM was estimated in the IS. alpha 1-Adrenergic stimulation induced periodic elevations of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and parallel synchronized transient declines in the IS. Subsequent application of the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$-pump inhibitor thapsigargin resulted in a release of Ca$^{2+}$ from the IS to reach a level of Ca$^{2+}$ depletion much lower than the lowest transient decline observed during the oscillations.},

abstract = {Apoptosis serves as a protective mechanism by eliminating damaged cells through programmed cell death. After apoptotic cells pass critical checkpoints, including mitochondrial fragmentation, executioner caspase activation, and DNA damage, it is assumed that cell death inevitably follows. However, this assumption has not been tested directly. Here we report an unexpected reversal of late-stage apoptosis in primary liver and heart cells, macrophages, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, cervical cancer HeLa cells, and brain cells. After exposure to an inducer of apoptosis, cells exhibited multiple morphological and biochemical hallmarks of late-stage apoptosis, including mitochondrial fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and DNA damage. Surprisingly, the vast majority of dying cells arrested the apoptotic process and recovered when the inducer was washed away. Of importance, some cells acquired permanent genetic changes and underwent oncogenic transformation at a higher frequency than controls. Global gene expression analysis identified a molecular signature of the reversal process. We propose that reversal of apoptosis is an unanticipated mechanism to rescue cells from crisis and propose to name this mechanism "anastasis" (Greek for "rising to life"). Whereas carcinogenesis represents a harmful side effect, potential benefits of anastasis could include preservation of cells that are difficult to replace and stress-induced genetic diversity.},

abstract = {Necrosis has long been described as a consequence of physico-chemical stress and thus accidental and uncontrolled. Recently, it is becoming clear that necrotic cell death is as well controlled and programmed as caspase-dependent apoptosis, and that it may be an important cell death mode that is both pathologically and physiologically relevant. Necrotic cell death is not the result of one well-described signalling cascade but is the consequence of extensive crosstalk between several biochemical and molecular events at different cellular levels. Recent data indicate that serine/threonine kinase RIP1, which contains a death domain, may act as a central initiator. Calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are main players during the propagation and execution phases of necrotic cell death, directly or indirectly provoking damage to proteins, lipids and DNA, which culminates in disruption of organelle and cell integrity. Necrotically dying cells initiate pro-inflammatory signalling cascades by actively releasing inflammatory cytokines and by spilling their contents when they lyse. Unravelling the signalling cascades contributing to necrotic cell death will permit us to develop tools to specifically interfere with necrosis at certain levels of signalling. Necrosis occurs in both physiological and pathophysiological processes, and is capable of killing tumour cells that have developed strategies to evade apoptosis. Thus detailed knowledge of necrosis may be exploited in therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {We investigate the various types of complex Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations which can arise in a model based on the mechanism of Ca$^{2+}$-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release (CICR), that takes into account the Ca$^{2+}$-stimulated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) by a 3-kinase. This model was previously proposed in the course of an investigation of plausible mechanisms capable of generating complex Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. Besides simple periodic behavior, this model for cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in nonexcitable cells shows complex oscillatory phenomena like bursting or chaos. We show that the model also admits a coexistence between two stable regimes of sustained oscillations (birhythmicity). The occurrence of these various modes of oscillatory behavior is analysed by means of bifurcation diagrams. Complex oscillations are characterized by means of Poincar\'{e} sections, power spectra and Lyapounov exponents. The results point to the role of self-modulation of the InsP3 signal by 3-kinase as a possible source for complex temporal patterns in Ca$^{2+}$ signaling.},

@article{Testa2004,
abstract = {Erythropoiesis is a complex multistep process encompassing the differentiation of hemopoietic stem cells to mature erythrocytes. The steps involved in this complex differentiation process are numerous and involve first the differentiation to early erythoid progenitors (burst-forming units-erythroid, BFU-E), then to late erythroid progenitors (colony-forming units-erythroid) and finally to morphologically recognizable erythroid precursors. A key event of late stages of erythropoiesis is nuclear condensation, followed by extrusion of the nucleus to produce enucleated reticulocytes and finally mature erythrocytes. During the differentiation process, the cells became progressively sensitive to erythropoietin that controls both the survival and proliferation of erythroid cells. A normal homeostasis of the erythropoietic system requires an appropriate balance between the rate of erythroid cell production and red blood cell destruction. Growing evidences outlined in the present review indicate that apoptotic mechanism play a relevant role in the control of erythropoiesis under physiologic and pathologic conditions. Withdrawal of erythropoietin or stimulation of death receptors such as Fas or TRAIL-Rs leads to activation of a subset of caspase-3, -7 and -8, which then cleave the transcription factors GATA-1 and TAL-1 and trigger apoptosis. In addition, there is evidence that a number of caspases are physiologically activated during erythroid differentiation and are functionally required for erythroid maturation. Several caspase substrates are cleaved in differentiating cells, including the protein acinus whose activation by cleavage is required for chromatin condensation. The studies on normal erythropoiesis have clearly indicated that immature erythroid precursors are sensitive to apoptotic triggering mediated by activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. These apoptotic mechanisms are frequently exacerbated in some pathologic conditions, associated with the development of anemia (ie, thalassemias, multiple myeloma, myelodysplasia, aplastic anemia). The considerable progress in our understanding of the apoptotic mechanisms underlying normal and pathologic erythropoiesis may offer the way to improve the treatment of several pathologic conditions associated with the development of anemia.},

abstract = {Mitochondria play a pivotal role in intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signalling by taking up and releasing the ion upon specific conditions. In order to do so, mitochondria depend on a number of factors, such as the mitochondrial membrane potential and spatio-temporal constraints. Whereas most of the basic principles underlying mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling have been successfully deciphered over the last 50 years using assays based on in vitro preparations of mitochondria or cultured cells, we have only just started to understand the actual physiological relevance of these processes in the whole animal. Recent advancements in imaging and genetically encoded sensor technologies have allowed us to visualise mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transients in live mice. These studies used either two-photon microscopy or bioluminescence imaging of cameleon or aequorin-GFP Ca$^{2+}$ sensors, respectively. Both methods revealed a consistent picture of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake into mitochondria under physiological conditions even during very short-lasting elevations of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ levels. The big future challenge is to understand the functional impact of such Ca$^{2+}$ signals on the physiology of the observed tissue as well as of the whole organism. To that end, the development of multiparametric in vivo approaches will be mandatory.},

abstract = {Calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) signaling plays a key role in a wide range of physiological functions including control of cardiac and skeletal muscle performance. To assure a precise coordination of both temporally and spatially transduction of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations to downstream signaling networks and target operations, Ca$^{2+}$ cycling regulation in muscle tissue is conducted by a plethora of diverse molecules. Ca$^{2+}$ S100A1 is a member of the Ca$^{2+}$-binding S100 protein family and represents the most abundant S100 isoform in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Early studies revealed distinct expression patterns of S100A1 in healthy and diseased cardiac tissue from animal models and humans. Further elaborate investigations uncovered S100A1 protein as a basic requirement for striated muscle Ca$^{2+}$ handling integrity. S100A1 is a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte Ca$^{2+}$ cycling and contractile performance. S100A1-mediated inotropy unfolds independent and on top of beta AR-stimulated contractility with unchanged beta AR downstream signaling. S100A1 has further been detected at different sites within the cardiac sarcomere indicating potential roles in myofilament function. More recently, a study reported a mitochondrial location of S100A1 in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, normalizing the level of S100A1 protein by means of viral cardiac gene transfer in animal heart failure models resulted in a disrupted progression towards cardiac failure and enhanced survival. This brief review is confined to the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of S100A1 in cardiac and skeletal muscle Ca$^{2+}$ handling with a particular focus on its potential as a molecular target for future therapeutic interventions.},

To date, there have been no reported structure-function studies to substantiate the function of any putative domains of perforin, which have been postulated totally on primary sequence similarities with domains in other proteins. In this report, we have used recently developed modalities for expressing full-length perforin and robust functional assays to investigate one of the hallmarks of perforin function: its absolute dependence on calcium for lipid binding and cell lysis. We provide, for the first time, experimental evidence that the predicted C-terminal C2 motif constitutes a functional domain that is responsible for membrane binding of perforin. Whereas conserved aspartate residues at positions 429, 435, 483, and 485 were essential for calcium-dependent plasma membrane binding and cell lysis, the contribution of Asp-491 was limited. Finally, after experimentally verifying an optimized three-dimensional model, we have made predictions on the impact of two inherited perforin mutations of the C2 domain on calcium-dependent lipid binding and cell lysis.},

abstract = {Studies in Bristol in the 1960s and 1970s, led to the recognition that four mitochondrial dehydrogenases are activated by calcium ions. These are FAD-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. FAD-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase is located on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is influenced by changes in cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration. The other three enzymes are located within mitochondria and are regulated by changes in mitochondrial matrix calcium ion concentration. These and subsequent studies on purified enzymes, mitochondria and intact cell preparations have led to the widely accepted view that the activation of these enzymes is important in the stimulation of the respiratory chain and hence ATP supply under conditions of increased ATP demand in many stimulated mammalian cells. The effects of calcium ions on FAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase involve binding to an EF-hand binding motif within this enzyme but the binding sites involved in the effects of calcium ions on the three intramitochondrial dehydrogenases remain to be fully established. It is also emphasised in this article that these three dehydrogenases appear only to be regulated by calcium ions in vertebrates and that this raises some interesting and potentially important developmental issues.},

abstract = {Many physiological events require transient increases in cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are ion channels that govern the release of Ca$^{2+}$ from the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in RyRs can lead to severe genetic conditions that affect both cardiac and skeletal muscle, but locating the mutated residues in the full-length channel structure has been difficult. Here we show the 2.5 \AA resolution crystal structure of a region spanning three domains of RyR type 1 (RyR1), encompassing amino acid residues 1-559. The domains interact with each other through a predominantly hydrophilic interface. Docking in RyR1 electron microscopy maps unambiguously places the domains in the cytoplasmic portion of the channel, forming a 240-kDa cytoplasmic vestibule around the four-fold symmetry axis. We pinpoint the exact locations of more than 50 disease-associated mutations in full-length RyR1 and RyR2. The mutations can be classified into three groups: those that destabilize the interfaces between the three amino-terminal domains, disturb the folding of individual domains or affect one of six interfaces with other parts of the receptor. We propose a model whereby the opening of a RyR coincides with allosterically coupled motions within the N-terminal domains. This process can be affected by mutations that target various interfaces within and across subunits. The crystal structure provides a framework to understand the many disease-associated mutations in RyRs that have been studied using functional methods, and will be useful for developing new strategies to modulate RyR function in disease states.},

The present review summarizes the most pertinent recent evidence regarding the structural and functional properties of TRP channels, focusing on the regulation and physiology of mammalian TRPs.},

abstract = {AIM: To study the origin of calcium necessary for agonist-induced contraction of the distal colon in rats.

METHODS: The change in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]i) evoked by elevating external Ca$^{2+}$ was detected by fura 2/AM fluorescence. Contractile activity was measured with a force displacement transducer. Tension was continuously monitored and recorded using a Powerlab 4/25T data acquisition system with an ML110 bridge bioelectric physiographic amplifier.

RESULTS: Store depletion induced Ca$^{2+}$ influx had an effect on [Ca$^{2+}$]i. In nominally Ca$^{2+}$-free medium, the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (1 mumol/L) increased [Ca$^{2+}$]i from 68 to 241 nmol/L, and to 458 (P < 0.01) and 1006 nmol/L (P < 0.01), respectively, when 1.5 mmol/L and 3.0 mmol/L extracellular Ca$^{2+}$ was reintroduced. Furthermore, the change in [Ca$^{2+}$]i was observed with verapamil (5 micromol/L), La3+ (1 mmol/L) or KCl (40 mmol/L) in the bathing solution. These channels were sensitive to La3+ (P < 0.01), insensitive to verapamil, and voltage independent. In isolated distal colons we found that in normal Krebs solution, contraction induced by acetylcholine (ACh) was partially inhibited by verapamil, and the inhibitory rate was 41\% (P < 0.05). On the other hand, in Ca$^{2+}$-free Krebs solution, ACh induced transient contraction due to Ca$^{2+}$ release from the intracellular stores. The transient contraction lasted until the Ca$^{2+}$ store was depleted. Restoration of extracellular Ca$^{2+}$ in the presence of atropine produced contraction, mainly due to Ca$^{2+}$ influx. Such contraction was not inhibited by verapamil, but was decreased by La3+ (50 micromol/L) from 0.96 to 0.72 g (P < 0.01).

CONCLUSION: The predominant source of activator Ca$^{2+}$ for the contractile response to agonist is extracellular Ca$^{2+}$, and intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ has little role to play in mediating excitation-contraction coupling by agonists in rat distal colon smooth muscle in vitro. The influx of extracellular Ca$^{2+}$ is mainly mediated through voltage-, receptor- and store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ channels, which can be used as an alternative to develop new drugs targeted on the dysfunction of digestive tract motility.},

abstract = {Mitochondria play a central role in energy metabolism, Ca$^{2+}$ signalling, aging and cell death. To control cytosolic or mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentration, mitochondria possess several Ca$^{2+}$-transport systems across the inner membrane. However, the pathway for Ca$^{2+}$ crossing the outer membrane has not been directly addressed. We report that purified voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) reconstituted into lipid bilayers or liposomes is highly permeable to Ca$^{2+}$. VDAC contains Ca$^{2+}$-binding sites that bind Ruthenium Red (RuR), La(3+) and that RuR completely closed VDACs in single or multichannel experiments. Energized, freshly prepared mitochondria accumulate Ca$^{2+}$ (500-700 nmol/mg of protein), and subsequently released it. The release of Ca$^{2+}$ is accompanied by cyclosporin A-inhibited swelling, suggesting activation of permeability transition pore (PTP). RuR and ruthenium amine binuclear complex, when added to mitochondria after Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation has reached a maximal level and before PTP is activated, prevented the release of Ca$^{2+}$ and the accompanied mitochondrial swelling. RuR also prevented PTP opening promoted by atractyloside, an adenine nucleotide translocase inhibitor. These results suggest that VDAC, located in the mitochondrial outer membrane, controls Ca$^{2+}$ transport into and from the mitochondria, and that the inhibition of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by RuR and La(3+) may result from their interaction with VDAC Ca$^{2+}$-binding sites. Inhibition of PTP opening or assembly by RuR and ruthenium amine binuclear complex suggest the involvement of VDAC in PTP activity and/or regulation. The permeability of VDAC to Ca$^{2+}$ and its binding of Ca$^{2+}$, suggest that VDAC has a role in regulation of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ homoeostasis.},

abstract = {Mitochondria convert the energy stored in carbohydrate and fat into ATP molecules that power enzymatic reactions within cells, and this process influences cellular calcium signals in several ways. By providing ATP to calcium pumps at the plasma and intracellular membranes, mitochondria power the calcium gradients that drive the release of Ca²⁺ from stores and the entry of Ca²⁺ across plasma membrane channels. By taking up and subsequently releasing calcium ions, mitochondria determine the spatiotemporal profile of cellular Ca²⁺ signals and the activity of Ca²⁺-regulated proteins, including Ca²⁺ entry channels that are themselves part of the Ca²⁺ circuitry. Ca²⁺ elevations in the mitochondrial matrix, in turn, activate Ca²⁺-dependent enzymes that boost the respiratory chain, increasing the ability of mitochondria to buffer calcium ions. Mitochondria are able to encode and decode Ca²⁺ signals because the respiratory chain generates an electrochemical gradient for protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This proton motive force ($\Delta$p) drives the activity of the ATP synthase and has both an electrical component, the mitochondrial membrane potential ($\Delta$$\Psi$(m)), and a chemical component, the mitochondrial proton gradient ($\Delta$pH(m)). $\Delta$$\Psi$(m) contributes about 190 mV to $\Delta$p and drives the entry of Ca²⁺ across a recently identified Ca²⁺-selective channel known as the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uniporter. $\Delta$pH(m) contributes \~{}30 mV to $\Delta$p and is usually ignored or considered a minor component of mitochondria respiratory state. However, the mitochondrial proton gradient is an essential component of the chemiosmotic theory formulated by Peter Mitchell in 1961 as $\Delta$pH(m) sustains the entry of substrates and metabolites required for the activity of the respiratory chain and drives the activity of electroneutral ion exchangers that allow mitochondria to maintain their osmolarity and volume. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms that regulate the mitochondrial proton gradient and discuss how thermodynamic concepts derived from measurements in purified mitochondria can be reconciled with our recent findings that mitochondria have high proton permeability in situ and that $\Delta$pH(m) decreases during mitochondrial Ca²⁺ elevations.},

abstract = {Local Ca$^{2+}$ transfer between adjoining domains of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) and mitochondria allows ER/SR Ca$^{2+}$ release to activate mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake and to evoke a matrix [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$](m)) rise. [Ca$^{2+}$](m) exerts control on several steps of energy metabolism to synchronize ATP generation with cell function. However, calcium signal propagation to the mitochondria may also ignite a cell death program through opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP). This occurs when the Ca$^{2+}$ release from the ER/SR is enhanced or is coincident with sensitization of the PTP. Recent studies have shown that several pro-apoptotic factors, including members of the Bcl-2 family proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate the Ca$^{2+}$ sensitivity of both the Ca$^{2+}$ release channels in the ER and the PTP in the mitochondria. To test the relevance of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation in various apoptotic paradigms, methods are available for buffering of [Ca$^{2+}$], for dissipation of the driving force of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake and for inhibition of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport mechanisms. However, in intact cells, the efficacy and the specificity of these approaches have to be established. Here we discuss mechanisms that recruit the mitochondrial calcium signal to a pro-apoptotic cascade and the approaches available for assessment of the relevance of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling in apoptosis. We also present a systematic evaluation of the effect of ruthenium red and Ru360, two inhibitors of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake on cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] and [Ca$^{2+}$](m) in intact cultured cells.},

Intramitochondrial free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$](m)) has been found to be an important component of control of the rate of this ATP production. In addition, [Ca$^{2+}$](m) also controls the opening of a large pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane, the permeability transition pore (PTP), which plays a role in mitochondrial control of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Therefore, [Ca$^{2+}$](m) can control whether the cell has sufficient ATP to fulfill its functions and survive or is condemned to death. Ca$^{2+}$ is also one of the most important second messengers within the cytosol, signaling changes in cellular response through Ca$^{2+}$ pulses or transients. Mitochondria can also sequester Ca$^{2+}$ from these transients so as to modify the shape of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling transients or control their location within the cell. All of this is controlled by the action of four or five mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport mechanisms and the PTP. The characteristics of these mechanisms of Ca$^{2+}$ transport and a discussion of how they might function are described in this paper.},

In both HeLa cells and primary cultures of skeletal myotubes, stimulation with agonists evoking cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ signals caused increases in [ATP](m) and [ATP](c) that depended on two parameters: (i) the amplitude of the Ca$^{2+}$ rise in the mitochondrial matrix, and (ii) the availability of mitochondrial substrates. Moreover, the Ca$^{2+}$ elevation induced a long-lasting priming that persisted long after agonist washout and caused a major increase in [ATP](m) upon addition of oxidative substrates. These results demonstrate a direct role of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ in driving ATP production and unravel a form of cellular memory that allows a prolonged metabolic activation in stimulated cells.},

abstract = {Activation of cells by many extracellular agonists leads to the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ). IP 3 is a global messenger that easily diffuses in the cytosol. Its receptor (IP 3 R) is a Ca 2+ -release channel located on intracellular membranes, especially the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The IP 3 R has an affinity for IP 3 in the low nanomolar range. A prime regulator of the IP 3 R is the Ca 2+ ion itself. Cytosolic Ca 2+ is considered as a co-agonist of the IP 3 R, as it strongly increases IP 3 R activity at concentrations up to about 300 nM. In contrast, at higher concentrations, cytosolic Ca 2+ inhibits the IP 3 R. Also the luminal Ca 2+ sensitizes the IP 3 R. In higher organisms three genes encode for an IP 3 R and additional diversity exists as a result of alternative splicing mechanisms and the formation of homo- and heterotetramers. The various IP 3 R isoforms have a similar structure and a similar function, but due to differences in their affinity for IP 3 , their variable sensitivity to regulatory parameters, their differential interaction with associated proteins, and the variation in their subcellular localization, they participate differently in the formation of intracellular Ca 2+ signals and this affects therefore the physiological consequences of these signals.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, there has been a growing interest in unraveling the role that the Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger (NCX) plays in the function and regulation of several cellular activities. Molecular biology, electrophysiology, genetically modified mice, and molecular pharmacology have helped to delve deeper and more successfully into the physiological and pathophysiological role of this exchanger. In fact, this nine-transmembrane protein, widely distributed in the brain and in the heart, works in a bidirectional way. Specifically, when it operates in the forward mode of operation, it couples the extrusion of one Ca$^{2+}$ ion with the influx of three Na$^+$ ions. In contrast, when it operates in the reverse mode of operation, while three Na$^+$ ions are extruded, one Ca$^{2+}$ enters into the cells. Different isoforms of NCX, named NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3, have been described in the brain, whereas only one, NCX1, has been found in the heart. The hypothesis that NCX can play a relevant role in several pathophysiological conditions, including hypoxia-anoxia, white matter degeneration after spinal cord injury, brain trauma and optical nerve injury, neuronal apoptosis, brain aging, and Alzheimer's disease, stems from the observation that NCX, in parallel with selective ion channels and ATP-dependent pumps, is efficient at maintaining intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ and Na$^+$ homeostasis. In conclusion, although studies concerning the involvement of NCX in the pathological mechanisms underlying brain injury during neurodegenerative diseases started later than those related to heart disease, the availability of pharmacological agents able to selectively modulate each NCX subtype activity and antiporter mode of operation will provide a better understanding of its pathophysiological role and, consequently, more promising approaches to treat these neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Elevation of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]i) to levels below 1 microm alters synaptic transmission and induces short-term plasticity. To identify calcium sensors involved in this signalling, we investigated soluble C2 domain-containing proteins and found that both DOC2A and DOC2B are modulated by submicromolar calcium levels. Fluorescent-tagged DOC2A and DOC2B translocated to plasma membranes after [Ca$^{2+}$]i elevation. DOC2B translocation preceded DOC2A translocation in cells co-expressing both isoforms. Half-maximal translocation occurred at 450 and 175 nm[Ca$^{2+}$]i for DOC2A and DOC2B, respectively. This large difference in calcium sensitivity was accompanied by a modest kinetic difference (halftimes, respectively, 2.6 and 2.0 s). The calcium sensitivity of DOC2 isoforms can be explained by predicted topologies of their C2A domains. Consistently, neutralization of aspartates D218 and D220 in DOC2B changed its calcium affinity. In neurones, both DOC2 isoforms were reversibly recruited to the plasma membrane during trains of action potentials. Consistent with its higher calcium sensitivity, DOC2B translocated at lower depolarization frequencies. Styryl dye uptake experiments in hippocampal neurones suggest that the overexpression of mutated DOC2B alters the synaptic activity. We conclude that both DOC2A and DOC2B are regulated by neuronal activity, and hypothesize that their calcium-dependent translocation may regulate synaptic activity.},

abstract = {Mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are two important metabolic organelles for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and their functional defects are suspected to participate to the aetiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Particularly, excessive lipid intake and/or ectopic lipid accumulation in tissues (referred as lipotoxicity) are involved in alterations of both organelles and are closely linked to peripheral insulin resistance and defective insulin secretion. Since, mitochondria and ER are physically and functionally interconnected, their respective alterations during T2D could be interrelated. However, the mechanisms that coordinate the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress, and its relevance in the control of glucose homeostasis are unknown. Among these mechanisms, we will discuss on the potential role of altered mitochondria/ER crosstalk in organelle dysfunctions and in T2D pathophysiology.},

In eukaryotic cells, Ca$^{2+}$ storage is achieved within specific intracellular organelles, especially the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum, in which Ca$^{2+}$ is buffered by specific proteins known as Ca$^{2+}$ buffers. Ca$^{2+}$ buffers are a diverse group of proteins, varying in their affinities and capacities for Ca$^{2+}$, but they typically also carry out other functions within the cell. The wide range of organelles containing Ca$^{2+}$ and the evidence supporting cross-talk between these organelles suggest the existence of a dynamic network of organellar Ca$^{2+}$ signaling, mediated by a variety of organellar Ca$^{2+}$ buffers.},

abstract = {Trichoplein/mitostatin (TpMs) is a keratin-binding protein that partly colocalizes with mitochondria and is often downregulated in epithelial cancers, but its function remains unclear. In this study, we report that TpMs regulates the tethering between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2)-dependent manner. Subcellular fractionation and immunostaining show that TpMs is present at the interface between mitochondria and ER. The expression of TpMs leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and loosens tethering with ER, whereas its silencing has opposite effects. Functionally, the reduced tethering by TpMs inhibits apoptosis by Ca$^{2+}$-dependent stimuli that require ER-mitochondria juxtaposition. Biochemical and genetic evidence support a model in which TpMs requires Mfn2 to modulate mitochondrial shape and tethering. Thus, TpMs is a new regulator of mitochondria-ER juxtaposition.},

We have studied the control of Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases (CSMDHs) by monitoring mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) and the redox state of flavoproteins and pyridine nucleotides simultaneously with [Ca$^{2+}$]c in single hepatocytes. Oscillations of [Ca$^{2+}$]c induced by IP3-dependent hormones were efficiently transmitted to the mitochondria as [Ca$^{2+}$]m oscillations. Each [Ca$^{2+}$]m spike was sufficient to cause a maximal transient activation of the CSMDHs and [Ca$^{2+}$]m oscillations at frequencies above 0.5 per minute caused a sustained activation of mitochondrial metabolism. By contrast, sustained [Ca$^{2+}$]c increases yielded only transient CSMDH activation, and slow or partial [Ca$^{2+}$]c elevations were ineffective in increasing [Ca$^{2+}$]m or stimulating CSMDHs. We conclude that the mitochondria are tuned to oscillating [Ca$^{2+}$]c signals, the frequency of which can control the CSMDHs over the full range of potential activities.},

abstract = {It is known that the nucleoplasmic ionised calcium concentration (Can) controls nuclear functions such as transcription, although the source and nature of the signals which modulate Can are unclear. Using confocal imaging, we investigated the subcellular origin of Can signals in Fluo-3-loaded HeLa cells. Our data indicate that all signals which increased Can were of cytoplasmic origin. Can was elevated during the propagation of global Ca waves within cells. More strikingly, we found that individual cytoplasmic elementary release events e.g. Ca puffs, evoked by physiological levels of stimulation, caused transient Can increases. Significantly, >70\% of all Ca puffs originated within a 2-3 micron perinuclear zone and propagated anisotropically across the entire nucleus. Due to the relatively slow relaxation of Can transients compared with those in the cytoplasm, repetitive perinuclear Ca puffs were integrated into a 'staircase' of increasing Can. Due to the effective diffusion of Ca in the nucleoplasm, the nucleus served as a 'Ca tunnel', distributing Ca to parts of the cytosol which were otherwise not within the cytoplasmic diffusion radii of Ca puffs. Given the close proximity of the majority of puff sites to the nucleus, it seems that the elementary Ca release system is designed to facilitate nuclear Ca signalling. Consequently, Ca-dependent regulation of nuclear function must be considered at the microscopic elementary level.},

abstract = {BH3-only BCL-2 family proteins are effectors of canonical mitochondrial apoptosis. They discharge their pro-apoptotic functions through BH1-3 pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, while their activity is suppressed by BH1-4 anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. The precise mechanism by which BH3-only proteins mediate apoptosis remains unresolved. The existing data are consistent with three mutually non-exclusive models (1) displacement of BH1-3 proteins from complexes with BH1-4 proteins; (2) direct interaction with and conformational activation of BH1-3 proteins; and (3) membrane insertion and membrane remodeling. The BH3-only proteins appear to play critical roles in restraining cancer and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Molecules that mimic the effect of BH3-only proteins are being used in treatments against these diseases. The cell death activity of a subclass of BH3-only members (BNIP3 and BNIP3L) is linked to cardiomyocyte loss during heart failure. In addition to their established role in apoptosis, several BH3-only members also regulate diverse cellular functions in cell-cycle regulation, DNA repair and metabolism. Several members are implicated in the induction of autophagy and autophagic cell death, possibly through unleashing of the BH3-only autophagic effector Beclin 1 from complexes with BCL-2/BCL-xL. The Chapters included in the current Oncogene Review issues provide in-depth discussions on various aspects of major BH3-only proteins.},

Here, we show that in mast cells, Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains from store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ release-activated Ca$^{2+}$ channels activate expression of the transcription factor c-fos. Local Ca$^{2+}$ entry is sensed by the tyrosine kinase Syk, which signals to the nucleus through the transcription factor STAT5. Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains also promote secretion of proinflammatory messengers, which, like gene expression, requires Syk. Syk therefore couples Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains to the activation of two spatially and temporally distinct cellular responses, revealing the versatility of local Ca$^{2+}$ signals in driving cell activation.},

abstract = {During cell activation, mitochondria play an important role in Ca$^{2+}$ homoeostasis due to the presence of a fast and specific Ca$^{2+}$ channel in its inner membrane, the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter. This channel allows mitochondria to buffer local cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] changes and controls the intramitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ levels, thus modulating a variety of phenomena from respiratory rate to apoptosis. We have described recently that SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), strongly activated the uniporter. We show in the present study that a series of natural plant flavonoids, widely distributed in foods, produced also a strong stimulation of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter. This effect was of the same magnitude as that induced by SB202190 (an approx. 20-fold increase in the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake rate), developed without measurable delay and was rapidly reversible. In intact cells, the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ peak induced by histamine was also largely increased by the flavonoids. Stimulation of the uniporter by either flavonoids or SB202190 did not require ATP, suggesting a direct effect on the uniporter or an associated protein which is not mediated by protein phosphorylation. The most active compound, kaempferol, increased the rate of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by 85+/-15\% (mean+/-S.E.M., n=4) and the histamine-induced mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ peak by 139+/-19\% (mean+/-S.E.M., n=5) at a concentration of 1 microM. Given that flavonoids can reach this concentration range in plasma after ingestion of flavonoid-rich food, these compounds could be modulating the uniporter under physiological conditions.},

abstract = {Indirect findings in the 1950s had indicated that mitochondria could accumulate Ca$^{2+}$, but only in 1961 isolated mitochondria were directly shown to take it up in a process driven by the activity of the respiratory chain or by the hydrolysis of added ATP. The uptake of Ca$^{2+}$ could be accompanied by the simultaneous uptake of inorganic phosphate, leading to the precipitation of hydroxyapatite in the matrix and to the effective buffering of the free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration in it. The uptake of Ca$^{2+}$ occurred via an electrophoretic uniporter that has been molecularly identified only recently. Ca$^{2+}$ was then released through a Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger that has also been identified very recently (a H(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ antiporter has also been described in some mitochondrial types). In the matrix two TCA cycle dehydrogenases and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase were found to be regulated by Ca$^{2+}$, providing a rationale for the Ca$^{2+}$ cycling process. The affinity of the uptake uniporter was found to be too low to efficiently regulate Ca$^{2+}$ in the low to mid nM concentration in the cytosol. However, a number of findings showed that energy linked transport of Ca$^{2+}$ did nevertheless occur in mitochondria in situ. The enigma was solved in the 1990s, when it was found that perimitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ pools are created by the discharge of Ca$^{2+}$ from vicinal endoplasmic reticulum stores in which the concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ is high enough to satisfy the poor affinity of the uniporter. Thus, mitochondria have now regained a key role in the regulation of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ (not only of their own internal Ca$^{2+}$).},

Ablation or silencing of mitofusin 2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HeLa cells disrupts ER morphology and loosens ER-mitochondria interactions, thereby reducing the efficiency of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake in response to stimuli that generate inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate. An in vitro assay as well as genetic and biochemical evidences support a model in which mitofusin 2 on the ER bridges the two organelles by engaging in homotypic and heterotypic complexes with mitofusin 1 or 2 on the surface of mitochondria. Thus, mitofusin 2 tethers ER to mitochondria, a juxtaposition required for efficient mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake.},

Here we have implemented a general mathematical model to simulate the impact of store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry on intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. In addition, we have compared two different models of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) and their influences on intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. Store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry following Ca$^{2+}$ depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important component of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling. We have developed a phenomenological model of store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry via store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ (SOC) channels, which are activated upon ER Ca$^{2+}$ depletion. The depletion evokes a bi-phasic Ca$^{2+}$ signal, which is also produced in our mathematical model. The IP3R is an important regulator of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals. This IP3 sensitive Ca$^{2+}$ channel is also regulated by Ca$^{2+}$. We apply two IP3R models, the Mak-McBride-Foskett model and the De Young and Keizer model, with significantly different channel characteristics. Our results show that the two separate IP3R models evoke intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations with different frequencies and amplitudes. Store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry affects the oscillatory behavior of these intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. The IP3 threshold is altered when store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry is excluded from the model. Frequencies and amplitudes of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations are also altered without store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry. Under certain conditions, when intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations are absent, excluding store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry induces an oscillatory response. These findings increase knowledge concerning store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry and its impact on intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations.},

@article{Hayashi2007,
abstract = {Communication between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrion is important for bioenergetics and cellular survival. The ER supplies Ca$^{2+}$ directly to mitochondria via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) at close contacts between the two organelles referred to as mitochondrion-associated ER membrane (MAM). We found here that the ER protein sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), which is implicated in neuroprotection, carcinogenesis, and neuroplasticity, is a Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive and ligand-operated receptor chaperone at MAM. Normally, Sig-1Rs form a complex at MAM with another chaperone, BiP. Upon ER Ca$^{2+}$ depletion or via ligand stimulation, Sig-1Rs dissociate from BiP, leading to a prolonged Ca$^{2+}$ signaling into mitochondria via IP3Rs. Sig-1Rs can translocate under chronic ER stress. Increasing Sig-1Rs in cells counteracts ER stress response, whereas decreasing them enhances apoptosis. These results reveal that the orchestrated ER chaperone machinery at MAM, by sensing ER Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations, regulates ER-mitochondrial interorganellar Ca$^{2+}$ signaling and cell survival.},

These models reproduced the large variability in oscillation frequency observed experimentally. In the present contribution, we extend our earlier model [Marhl et al., Biophys. Chem., 63 (1997) 221] by including, in addition to the ER, mitochondria as calcium stores. Simple plausible rate laws are used for the calcium uptake into, and release from, the mitochondria. It is demonstrated with the help of this extended model that mitochondria are likely to act in favour of frequency encoding by enabling the maintenance of fairly constant amplitudes over wide ranges of frequency.},

abstract = {STIM1 (where STIM is stromal interaction molecule) is a candidate tumour suppressor gene that maps to human chromosome 11p15.5, a region implicated in a variety of cancers, particularly embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. STIM1 codes for a transmembrane phosphoprotein whose structure is unrelated to that of any other known proteins. The precise pathway by which STIM1 regulates cell growth is not known. In the present study we screened gene databases for STIM1-related sequences, and have identified and characterized cDNA sequences representing a single gene in humans and other vertebrates, which we have called STIM2. We identified a single STIM homologue in Drosophila melanogaster (D-Stim) and Caenorhabditis elegans, but no homologues in yeast. STIM1, STIM2 and D-Stim have a conserved genomic organization, indicating that the vertebrate family of two STIM genes most probably arose from a single ancestral gene. The three STIM proteins each contain a single SAM (sterile alpha-motif) domain and an unpaired EF hand within the highly conserved extracellular region, and have coiled-coil domains that are conserved in structure and position within the cytoplasmic region. However, the STIM proteins diverge significantly within the C-terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain. Differential levels of phosphorylation appear to account for two molecular mass isoforms (105 and 115 kDa) of STIM2. We demonstrate by mutation analysis and protein sequencing that human STIM2 initiates translation exclusively from a non-AUG start site in vivo. STIM2 is expressed ubiquitously in cell lines, and co-precipitates with STIM1 from cell lysates. This association into oligomers in vivo indicates a possible functional interaction between STIM1 and STIM2. The structural similarities between STIM1, STIM2 and D-STIM suggest conserved biological functions.},

@article{Villinger2010,
abstract = {The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, acts as a gatekeeper for the entry and exit of mitochondrial metabolites. Here we reveal functional dynamics of isoform one of VDAC (VDAC1) by a combination of solution NMR spectroscopy, Gaussian network model analysis, and molecular dynamics simulation. Micro- to millisecond dynamics are significantly increased for the N-terminal six $\beta$-strands of VDAC1 in micellar solution, in agreement with increased B-factors observed in the same region in the bicellar crystal structure of VDAC1. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that a charge on the membrane-facing glutamic acid 73 (E73) accounts for the elevation of N-terminal protein dynamics as well as a thinning of the nearby membrane. Mutation or chemical modification of E73 strongly reduces the micro- to millisecond dynamics in solution. Because E73 is necessary for hexokinase-I-induced VDAC channel closure and inhibition of apoptosis, our results imply that micro- to millisecond dynamics in the N-terminal part of the barrel are essential for VDAC interaction and gating.},

@article{Scarpa1973,
abstract = {Initial velocities of energy-dependent Ca(++) uptake were measured by stopped-flow and dual-wavelength techniques in mitochondria isolated from hearts of rats, guinea pigs, squirrels, pigeons, and frogs. The rate of Ca(++) uptake by rat heart mitochondria was 0.05 nmol/mg/s at 5 microM Ca(++) and increased sigmoidally to 8 nmol/mg/s at 200 microM Ca(++). A Hill plot of the data yields a straight line with slope n of 2, indicating a cooperativity for Ca(++) transport in cardiac mitochondria. Comparable rates of Ca(++) uptake and sigmoidal plots were obtained with mitochondria from other mammalian hearts. On the other hand, the rates of Ca(++) uptake by frog heart mitochondria were higher at any Ca(++) concentrations. The half-maximal rate of Ca(++) transport was observed at 30, 60, 72, 87, 92 microM Ca(++) for cardiac mitochondria from frog, squirrel, pigeon, guinea pig, and rat, respectively. The sigmoidicity and the high apparent K(m) render mitochondrial Ca(++) uptake slow below 10 microM. At these concentrations the rate of Ca(++) uptake by cardiac mitochondria in vitro and the amount of mitochondria present in the heart are not consistent with the amount of Ca(++) to be sequestered in vivo during heart relaxation. Therefore, it appears that, at least in mammalian hearts, the energy-linked transport of Ca(++) by mitochondria is inadequate for regulating the beat-to-beat Ca(++) cycle. The results obtained and the proposed cooperativity for mitochondrial Ca(++) uptake are discussed in terms of physiological regulation of intracellular Ca(++) homeostasis in cardiac cells.},

@article{DiLeva2008a,
abstract = {Most important processes in cell life are regulated by calcium (Ca$^{2+}$). A number of mechanisms have thus been developed to maintain the concentration of free Ca$^{2+}$ inside cells at the level (100-200nM) necessary for the optimal operation of the targets of its regulatory function. The systems that move Ca$^{2+}$ back and forth across membranes are important actors in its control. The plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA pump) which ejects Ca$^{2+}$ from all eukaryotic cell types will be the topic of this contribution. The pump uses a molecule of ATP to transport one molecule of Ca$^{2+}$ from the cytosol to the external environment. It is a P-type ATPase encoded by four genes (ATP2B1-4), the transcripts of which undergo different types of alternative splicing. Many pump variants thus exist. Their multiplicity is best explained by the specific Ca$^{2+}$ demands in different cell types. In keeping with these demands, the isoforms are differently expressed in tissues and cell types and have differential Ca$^{2+}$ extruding properties. At very low Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations the PMCAs are nearly inactive. They must be activated by calmodulin, by acid phospholipids, by protein kinases, and by other means, e.g., a dimerization process. Other proteins interact with the PMCAs (i.e., MAGUK and NHERF at the PDZ domain and calcineurin A in the main intracellular domain) to sort them to specific regions of the cell membrane or to regulate their function. In some cases the interaction is isoform, or even splice variant specific. PMCAs knock out (KO) mice have been generated and have contributed information on the importance of PMCAs to cells and organisms. So far, only one human genetic disease, hearing loss, has been traced back to a PMCA defect.},

abstract = {We construct a minimal model of cytosolic free Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations based on Ca$^{2+}$ release via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor/Ca$^{2+}$ channel (IP3R) of a single intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ pool. The model relies on experimental evidence that the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]c) modulates the IP3R in a biphasic manner, with Ca$^{2+}$ release inhibited by low and high [Ca$^{2+}$]c and facilitated by intermediate [Ca$^{2+}$]c, and that channel inactivation occurs on a slower time scale than activation. The model produces [Ca$^{2+}$]c oscillations at constant [IP3] and reproduces a number of crucial experiments. The two-dimensional spatial model with IP3 dynamics, cytosolic diffusion of IP3 (Dp = 300 microns 2 s-1), and cytosolic diffusion of Ca$^{2+}$ (Dc = 20 microns 2 s-1) produces circular, planar, and spiral waves of Ca$^{2+}$ with speeds of 7-15 microns.s-1, which annihilate upon collision. Increasing extracellular [Ca$^{2+}$] influx increases wave speed and baseline [Ca$^{2+}$]c. A [Ca$^{2+}$]c-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ diffusion coefficient does not alter the qualitative behavior of the model. An important model prediction is that channel inactivation must occur on a slower time scale than activation in order for waves to propagate. The model serves to capture the essential macroscopic mechanisms that are involved in the production of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations and traveling waves in the Xenopus laevis oocyte.},

abstract = {1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) Ca$^{2+}$ antagonists have recently been shown to block T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels, which may render favorable actions on cardiovascular systems. However, this evaluation remains to be done systematically for each T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel subtype except for the Ca(v)3.1 (alpha(1G)) subtype. To address this issue at the molecular level, blocking effects of 14 kinds of DHPs (amlodipine, aranidipine, azelnidipine, barnidipine, benidipine, cilnidipine, efonidipine, felodipine, manidipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nilvadipine, nimodipine, nitrendipine), which are clinically used for treatments of hypertension, on 3 subtypes of T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels [Ca(v)3.2 (alpha(1H)), Ca(v)3.3 (alpha(1I)), and Ca(v)3.1 (alpha(1G))] were investigated in the Xenopus oocyte expression system using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. These 3 kinds (alpha(1H), alpha(1I) and alpha(1G)) of T-type channels were blocked by amlodipine, manidipine and nicardipine. On the other hand, azelnidipine, barnidipine, benidipine and efonidipine significantly blocked alpha(1H) and alpha(1G), but not alpha(1I) channels, while nilvadipine and nimodipine apparently blocked alpha(1H) and alpha(1I), but not alpha(1G) channels. Moreover, aranidipine blocked only alpha(1H) channels. By contrast, cilnidipine, felodipine, nifedipine and nitrendipine had little effects on these subtypes of T-type channels. The result indicates that the blockade of T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels by derivatives of DHP Ca$^{2+}$ antagonist was selective for the channel subtype.

abstract = {The permeability transition pore (PTP) is a channel of the inner mitochondrial membrane that appears to operate at the crossroads of two distinct physiological pathways, i.e., the Ca$^{2+}$ signaling network during the life of the cell, and the effector phase of the apoptotic cascade during Ca$^{2+}$-dependent cell death. Correspondingly, two open conformations of the PTP can also be observed in isolated organelles. A low-conductance state, that allows the diffusion of small ions like Ca$^{2+}$, is pH-operated, promoting spontaneous closure of the channel. A high-conductance state, that allows the unselective diffusion of big molecules, stabilizes the channel in the open conformation, disrupting in turn the mitochondrial structure and causing the release of proapoptotic factors. Our current results indicate that switching from low- to high-conductance state is an irreversible process that is strictly dependent on the saturation of the internal Ca$^{2+}$-binding sites of the PTP. Thus, the high-conductance state of the PTP, which was shown to play a pivotal role in the course of excitotoxic and thapsigargin-induced cell death, might result from a Ca$^{2+}$-dependent conformational shift of the low-conductance state, normally participating in the regulation of cellular Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis as a pH-operated channel. These observations lead us to propose a simple biophysical model of the transition between Ca$^{2+}$ signaling and Ca$^{2+}$-dependent apoptosis.},

abstract = {The paradigm of deterministic chaos has influenced thinking in many fields of science. Chaotic systems show rich and surprising mathematical structures. In the applied sciences, deterministic chaos provides a striking explanation for irregular behaviour and anomalies in systems which do not seem to be inherently stochastic. The most direct link between chaos theory and the real world is the analysis of time series from real systems in terms of nonlinear dynamics. Experimental technique and data analysis have seen such dramatic progress that, by now, most fundamental properties of nonlinear dynamical systems have been observed in the laboratory. Great efforts are being made to exploit ideas from chaos theory wherever the data displays more structure than can be captured by traditional methods. Problems of this kind are typical in biology and physiology but also in geophysics, economics, and many other sciences.},

abstract = {The mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger (mNCE) mediates efflux of Ca$^{2+}$ from mitochondria in exchange for influx of Na(+). We show that inhibition of the mNCE enhances mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in rat islets and INS-1 cells. The benzothiazepine CGP37157 inhibited mNCE activity in INS-1 cells (50\% inhibition at IC(50) = 1.5 micro mol/l) and increased the glucose-induced rise in mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ ([Ca$^{2+}$](m)) 2.1 times. Cellular ATP content was increased by 13\% in INS-1 cells and by 49\% in rat islets by CGP37157 (1 micro mol/l). Krebs cycle flux was also stimulated by CGP37157 when glucose was present. Insulin secretion was increased in a glucose-dependent manner by CGP37157 in both INS-1 cells and islets. In islets, CGP37157 increased insulin secretion dose dependently (half-maximal efficacy at EC(50) = 0.06 micro mol/l) at 8 mmol/l glucose and shifted the glucose dose response curve to the left. In perifused islets, mNCE inhibition had no effect on insulin secretion at 2.8 mmol/l glucose but increased insulin secretion by 46\% at 11 mmol/l glucose. The effects of CGP37157 could not be attributed to interactions with the plasma membrane sodium calcium exchanger, L-type calcium channels, ATP-sensitive K(+) channels, or [Ca$^{2+}$](m) uniporter. In hyperglycemic clamp studies of Wistar rats, CGP37157 increased plasma insulin and C-peptide levels only during the hyperglycemic phase of the study. These results illustrate the potential utility of agents that affect mitochondrial metabolism as novel insulin secretagogues.},

Here we have solved the crystal structure of the calcium ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1a) at 2.6 A resolution with two calcium ions bound in the transmembrane domain, which comprises ten alpha-helices. The two calcium ions are located side by side and are surrounded by four transmembrane helices, two of which are unwound for efficient coordination geometry. The cytoplasmic region consists of three well separated domains, with the phosphorylation site in the central catalytic domain and the adenosine-binding site on another domain. The phosphorylation domain has the same fold as haloacid dehalogenase. Comparison with a low-resolution electron density map of the enzyme in the absence of calcium and with biochemical data suggests that large domain movements take place during active transport.},

Aequorin-based methods to measure [Ca$^{2+}$](ER) offer several advantages: (i) targeting of the probe is extremely precise; (ii) the use of low Ca$^{2+}$-affinity aequorin allows covering a large dynamic range of [Ca$^{2+}$], from 10(-5) to 10(-3)M; (iii) aequorin is nearly insensitive to changes in Mg(2+) or pH, has a high signal-to-noise ratio and calibration of the results in [Ca$^{2+}$] is made straightforward using a simple algorithm; and (iv) the equipment required for luminescence measurements in cell populations is simple and low-cost. On the negative side, this technique has also some disadvantages: (i) the relatively low amount of emitted light makes difficult performing single-cell imaging studies; (ii) reconstitution of aequorin with coelenterazine requires previous complete depletion of Ca$^{2+}$ of the ER for 1-2h, a maneuver that may result in deleterious effects in some cells; (iii) because of the high rate of aequorin consumption at steady-state [Ca$^{2+}$](ER), only relatively brief experiments can be performed; and (iv) expression of ER-targeted aequorin requires previous transfection or infection to introduce the appropriate DNA construct, or alternatively the use of stable cell clones. Choosing aequorin or other techniques to measure [Ca$^{2+}$](ER) will depend of the correct balance between these properties in a particular problem.},

@article{Contreras2009,
abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in mitochondria has been mainly attributed to Ca$^{2+}$ entry to the matrix through the Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter and activation of mitochondrial matrix dehydrogenases. However, mitochondria can also sense increases in cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ through a mechanism that involves the aspartate-glutamate carriers, extramitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ activation of the NADH malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS). Both pathways are linked through the shared substrate alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG). Here we have studied the interplay between the two pathways under conditions of Ca$^{2+}$ activation. We show that alphaKG becomes limiting when Ca$^{2+}$ enters in brain or heart mitochondria, but not liver mitochondria, resulting in a drop in alphaKG efflux through the oxoglutarate carrier and in a drop in MAS activity. Inhibition of alphaKG efflux and MAS activity by matrix Ca$^{2+}$ in brain mitochondria was fully reversible upon Ca$^{2+}$ efflux. Because of their differences in cytosolic calcium concentration requirements, the MAS and Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter-mitochondrial dehydrogenase pathways are probably sequentially activated during a Ca$^{2+}$ transient, and the inhibition of MAS at the center of the transient may provide an explanation for part of the increase in lactate observed in the stimulated brain in vivo.},

abstract = {Organophosphate poisoning in the context of self-harm is a common medical emergency in Asia. Prolonged muscle weakness is an important but poorly understood cause of morbidity and mortality of the poisoning. This study examined mitochondrial function and its modulation by nitric oxide in muscle weakness of rats exposed to an acute, oral (0.8LD(50)) dose of monocrotophos. Muscle mitochondrial ATP synthase activity was inhibited in the rat in acute exposure to monocrotophos while respiration per se was not affected. This was accompanied by decreased mitochondrial uptake of calcium and increased levels of nitric oxide. Reactive cysteine groups of ATP synthase subunits were reduced in number, which may contribute to decreased enzyme activity. The decrease in ATP synthase activity and reactive cysteine groups of ATP synthase subunits was prevented by treatment of animals with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-N(G) Nitroarginine methyl ester, at 12 mg/kg body weight for 9 days in drinking water, prior to monocrotophos exposure. This indicated a role for nitric oxide in the process. The alterations in mitochondrial calcium uptake may influence cytosolic calcium levels and contribute to muscle weakness of acute organophosphate exposure.},

Targeted proteins usually report much higher [Ca$^{2+}$](M) values than fluorescent dyes, up to two orders of magnitude. However, we show here that the low-Ca$^{2+}$-affinity dye rhod-5N provides [Ca$^{2+}$](M) values similar to those reported by targeted aequorin, suggesting that the discrepancies are mainly due to the higher Ca$^{2+}$-affinity of the fluorescent dyes used. We find rhod-5N has an apparent in situ intramitochondrial Kd around 0.5mM. Addition of Ca$^{2+}$ buffers containing between 4.5 and 10$\mu$M [Ca$^{2+}$] to permeabilized cells loaded with rhod-5N induced increases in calibrated [Ca$^{2+}$](M) up to the 100$\mu$M-1mM range, which were dependent on mitochondrial membrane potential. Ca$^{2+}$ release from mitochondria was largely dependent on [Na(+)]. We have then used rhod-5N loaded cells to investigate the [Ca$^{2+}$](M) response to agonist stimulation at the single-cell and subcellular level. The [Ca$^{2+}$](M) peaks induced by histamine varied by nearly 10-fold among different cells, with a mean about 25$\mu$M. In the presence of the Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter stimulator kaempferol, the [Ca$^{2+}$](M) peaks induced by histamine were also highly variable, and the mean [Ca$^{2+}$](M) peak was 3-fold higher. Simultaneous measurement of cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] peaks showed little correlation among the heights of the peaks in both compartments. Studying the [Ca$^{2+}$](M) peaks at the subcellular level, we found significant heterogeneities among regions in the same cell. In particular, the [Ca$^{2+}$](M) increase in mitochondrial regions close to the nucleus was more than double that of mitochondrial regions far from the nucleus.},

Strong evidence has been accumulated supporting a central role of Ca$^{2+}$ in the regulation of cell death. In particular, in the context of the biochemical mechanisms of apoptosis, increasing evidence support a role for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria Ca$^{2+}$ cross talk as a crucial regulator of several pathways of apoptosis. Recent data highlight as also the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), by modulating the ER machinery at the contact sites between ER and mitochondria (the mitochondria associated membranes, MAMs), regulates cell survival through the ER-cytosol/mitochondria Ca$^{2+}$ signaling.},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$-ATPases (pumps) are key actors in the regulation of Ca$^{2+}$ in eukaryotic cells and are thus essential to the correct functioning of the cell machinery. They have high affinity for Ca$^{2+}$ and can efficiently regulate it down to very low concentration levels. Two of the pumps have been known for decades (the SERCA and PMCA pumps); one (the SPCA pump) has only become known recently. Each pump is the product of a multigene family, the number of isoforms being further increased by alternative splicing of the primary transcripts. The three pumps share the basic features of the catalytic mechanism but differ in a number of properties related to tissue distribution, regulation, and role in the cellular homeostasis of Ca$^{2+}$. The molecular understanding of the function of the pumps has received great impetus from the solution of the three-dimensional structure of one of them, the SERCA pump. These spectacular advances in the structure and molecular mechanism of the pumps have been accompanied by the emergence and rapid expansion of the topic of pump malfunction, which has paralleled the rapid expansion of knowledge in the topic of Ca$^{2+}$-signaling dysfunction. Most of the pump defects described so far are genetic: when they are very severe, they produce gross and global disturbances of Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis that are incompatible with cell life. However, pump defects may also be of a type that produce subtler, often tissue-specific disturbances that affect individual components of the Ca$^{2+}$-controlling and/or processing machinery. They do not bring cells to immediate death but seriously compromise their normal functioning.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by an increase in amyloid metabolism. The calcium hypothesis of AD explores how activation of the amyloidogenic pathway may function to remodel the neuronal Ca$^{2+}$ signaling pathways responsible for cognition. Hydrolysis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) yields two products that can influence Ca$^{2+}$ signaling. Firstly, the amyloids released to the outside form oligomers that enhance the entry of Ca$^{2+}$ that is pumped into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). An increase in the luminal level of Ca$^{2+}$ within the ER enhances the sensitivity of the ryanodine receptors (RYRs) to increase the amount of Ca$^{2+}$ being released from the internal stores. Secondly, the APP intracellular domain may alter the expression of key signaling components such as the RYR. It is proposed that this remodeling of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling will result in the learning and memory deficits that occur early during the onset of AD. In particular, the Ca$^{2+}$ signaling remodeling may erase newly acquired memories by enhancing the mechanism of long-term depression that depends on activation of the Ca$^{2+}$-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. The alteration in Ca$^{2+}$ signaling will also contribute to the neurodegeneration that characterizes the later stages of dementia.},

Among the structures which exhibited more notable changes throughout these developmental stages, were the mitochondria, ribosomes, nuclear envelope and nucleolus. Mitochondria which were initially round, dense with cristae oriented parallel to the surface changed to oval with less dense mitochondrial matrix and with cristae perpendicular to the mitochondrial membrane. Ribosomes and polyribosomes decreased in amount from 2 to 7-cell stages and increased again at the 16-cell stage. The nuclear envelope exhibited intense blebbing activity at the 4-cell stage, less at 7 and none at 16. The nucleolus initially very dense was progressively infiltrated by chromatin, became reticular at the 7-cell stage and appeared fully mature at the 16-cell stage. This study discloses structural details of human preimplantation embryos which may be of interest in the assessment of comparable material obtained in vitro. Some unique features that may have bearing on the ontogenesis of cell organelles and cell differentiation are discussed.},

abstract = {Chronic infection and inflammation of the airways is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The response of the CF airway epithelium to the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is characterized by altered inflammation and apoptosis. In this study, we examined innate immune recognition and epithelial responses at the level of the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) in polarized human airway epithelial cells upon infection by PAO1. We report that PAO1 activates cell surface receptors to elicit an intracellular signaling cascade leading to enhancement of gap junctional communication. Expression of Cx43 involved an opposite regulation exerted by JNK and p38 MAPKs. PAO1-induced apoptosis was increased in the presence of a JNK inhibitor, but latter effect was prevented by lentiviral expression of a Cx43-specific short hairpin RNA. Moreover, we found that JNK activity was upregulated by pharmacological inhibition of CFTR in Calu-3 cells, whereas correction of a CF airway cell line (CF15 cells) by adenoviral expression of CFTR reduced the activation of this MAPK. Interestingly, CFTR inhibition in Calu-3 cells was associated with decreased Cx43 expression and reduced apoptosis. These results indicate that Cx43 expression is a component of the response of airway epithelial cells to innate immune activation by regulating the survival/apoptosis balance. Defective CFTR could alter this equilibrium with deleterious consequences on the CF epithelial response to P. aeruginosa.},

@article{Wiltgen2010,
abstract = {A central concept in the field of learning and memory is that NMDARs are essential for synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Surprisingly then, multiple studies have found that behavioral experience can reduce or eliminate the contribution of these receptors to learning. The cellular mechanisms that mediate learning in the absence of NMDAR activation are currently unknown. To address this issue, we examined the contribution of Ca$^{2+}$-permeable AMPARs to learning and plasticity in the hippocampus. Mutant mice were engineered with a conditional genetic deletion of GluR2 in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (GluR2-cKO mice). Electrophysiology experiments in these animals revealed a novel form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that was independent of NMDARs and mediated by GluR2-lacking Ca$^{2+}$-permeable AMPARs. Behavioral analyses found that GluR2-cKO mice were impaired on multiple hippocampus-dependent learning tasks that required NMDAR activation. This suggests that AMPAR-mediated LTP interferes with NMDAR-dependent plasticity. In contrast, NMDAR-independent learning was normal in knockout mice and required the activation of Ca$^{2+}$-permeable AMPARs. These results suggest that GluR2-lacking AMPARs play a functional and previously unidentified role in learning; they appear to mediate changes in synaptic strength that occur after plasticity has been established by NMDARs.},

abstract = {Mathematical models simulating the dynamics of calcium redistribution (elicited by experimental interference with the pathways of calcium fluxes) in cellular compartments have been developed, based on a minimal scheme of the pathways of calcium fluxes in nonexcitable cells suspended in calcium-free medium. The models are consistent with available experimental data. All parameters are quantitatively related to the intrinsic properties of calcium adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) and cellular membranes; there is no interdependence between the parameters. The models can be used as the basis for quantitative analysis and interpretation of experimental data. The activities of plasma membrane and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (PMCA and SERCAs) are governed by different mechanisms. PMCA is likely to undergo transitions from inactive to active to "dormant" (not identical to the initial) and back to inactive states, the mean duration of the cycle lasting for minutes or longer. The sequence of the transitions is initiated, presumably, by an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration. The transition of PMCA from inactive to active (at least at low rates of increase in cytosolic calcium concentration) is likely to be slower than that from active to dormant. SERCA, presumably, transits from inactive to active state in response to increases in calcium leakage from calcium stores. Whereas PMCA extrudes excess calcium (a definite quantity of it) in a short pulse, SERCA retakes calcium back into the stores permanently at a high rate. The models presented here may be the best means for the moment to quantitatively relate the dynamics of calcium fluxes in nonexcitable cells with known or putative properties of the mechanisms underlying activation of calcium ATPases.},

@article{Sugimori1994,
abstract = {Transmitter release is considered to be a secretory event triggered by localized calcium influx which, by binding to a low-affinity Ca$^{2+}$ site at the presynaptic active zone, initiates vesicular exocytosis (1-7). In previous experiments with aequorin-loaded presynaptic terminals we visualized, upon tetanic presynaptic stimulation, small points of light produced by calcium concentration microdomains of about 300 microM (5). These microdomains had a diameter of about 0.5 microns (5) and covered 5-10\% of the total presynaptic membrane with an average density of 8.4 microns2 per 100 microns2, corresponding closely to the size and distribution of the active zones in that junction (6, 7). To understand in more detail the nature of these concentration microdomains, we obtained rapid video images (400/s) after injecting the photoprotein n-aequorin-J into the presynaptic terminals of squid giant synapses. Using that experimental approach, we determined that microdomains evoked by presynaptic spike activation had a duration of about 800 microseconds. Spontaneous quantum emission domains (QEDs) observed at about the same locations as the microdomains were smaller in amplitude, shorter in duration, and less frequent. These results illustrate the time course of the calcium concentration profiles responsible for transmitter release. Their extremely short duration compares closely with that of calcium current flow during a presynaptic action potential and indicates that, as theorized in the past (6-8), intracellular calcium concentration at the active zone remains high only for the duration of transmembrane calcium flow.},

abstract = {Intracellular calcium oscillations provide a natural clock that may be of crucial importance for the timing of many cellular processes. Elucidating of the mechanisms underlying these oscillations is of particular interest. The theoretical description presented here extends existing models of calcium oscillations by allowing for two types of proteins differing in their calcium-binding properties. This model reflects experimental findings by considering both a fast calcium-binding process to low-affinity protein binding sites such as found in the N-domains of calmodulin or troponin C and a class of high-affinity calcium binding proteins with slow binding kinetics e.g., \v{Z} parvalbumin or the C-domains of calmodulin and troponin C . Furthermore, recalling that calcium is mainly stored in small . subcompartments of the ER, it is argued that only a small fraction of its overall volume participates in the rapid release and uptake of calcium. The effect of the size of this fraction is studied. The hypothesis saying that any electric potential difference across the ER membrane would be dissipated by the highly permeant ions is critically examined by an analytical estimation based on the electroneutrality condition and by numerical integration of the complete model equations. It is predicted theoretically that the transmembrane potential of the ER calcium stores, which is up to now virtually impossible to determine in experiment, builds up in the millivolt range at physiological concentrations of monovalent ions. The phenomenology of oscillations is studied by numerical integration. The model reproduces experimentally observed values of frequency and amplitude as well as the typical spike-like shape of oscillations. The model reveals also the time course of a shift of the bound Ca2q population from the low-affinity binding sites to the high-affinity binding sites. q1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

abstract = {Control of energy metabolism by increases of mitochondrial matrix [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$](m)) may represent a fundamental mechanism to meet the ATP demand imposed by heart contractions, but the machinery underlying propagation of [Ca$^{2+}$] signals from ryanodine receptor Ca$^{2+}$ release channels (RyR) to the mitochondria remains elusive. Using permeabilized cardiac (H9c2) cells we investigated the cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$](c)) and [Ca$^{2+}$](m) signals elicited by activation of RyR. Caffeine, Ca$^{2+}$, and ryanodine evoked [Ca$^{2+}$](c) spikes that often appeared as frequency-modulated [Ca$^{2+}$](c) oscillations in these permeabilized cells. Rapid increases in [Ca$^{2+}$](m) and activation of the Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases were synchronized to the rising phase of the [Ca$^{2+}$](c) spikes. The RyR-mediated elevations of global [Ca$^{2+}$](c) were in the submicromolar range, but the rate of [Ca$^{2+}$](m) increases was as large as it was in the presence of 30 microm global [Ca$^{2+}$](c). Furthermore, RyR-dependent increases of [Ca$^{2+}$](m) were relatively insensitive to buffering of [Ca$^{2+}$](c) by EGTA. Therefore, RyR-driven rises of [Ca$^{2+}$](m) appear to result from large and rapid increases of perimitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$]. The falling phase of [Ca$^{2+}$](c) spikes was followed by a rapid decay of [Ca$^{2+}$](m). CGP37157 slowed down relaxation of [Ca$^{2+}$](m) spikes, whereas cyclosporin A had no effect, suggesting that activation of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ exchangers accounts for rapid reversal of the [Ca$^{2+}$](m) response with little contribution from the permeability transition pore. Thus, rapid activation of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake sites and Ca$^{2+}$ exchangers evoked by RyR-mediated local [Ca$^{2+}$](c) signals allow mitochondria to respond rapidly to single [Ca$^{2+}$](c) spikes in cardiac cells.},

abstract = {Calcium depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces oligomerisation, puncta formation and translocation of the ER Ca$^{2+}$ sensor proteins, STIM1 and -2 into plasma membrane (PM)-adjacent regions of the ER, where they activate the Orai1, -2 or -3 proteins present in the opposing PM. These proteins form ion channels through which store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ influx (SOC) occurs. Calcium ions exert negative feed-back on SOC. Here we examined whether subplasmalemmal mitochondria, which reduce this feed-back by Ca$^{2+}$ uptake, are located within or out of the high-Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains (HCMDs) formed between the ER and plasmalemmal Orai1 channels. For this purpose, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with Orai1, STIM1 labelled with YFP or mRFP and the mitochondrially targeted Ca$^{2+}$ sensitive fluorescent protein inverse-Pericam. Depletion of ER Ca$^{2+}$ with ATP+thapsigargin (in Ca$^{2+}$-free medium) induced the appearance of STIM1 puncta in the < or =100 nm wide subplasmalemmal space, as examined with TIRF. Mitochondria were located either in the gaps between STIM1-tagged puncta or in remote, STIM1-free regions. After addition of Ca$^{2+}$ mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentration increased irrespective of the mitochondrion-STIM1 distance. These observations indicate that mitochondria are exposed to Ca$^{2+}$ diffused laterally from the HCMDs formed between the PM and the subplasmalemmal ER.},

The model considers feedback inhibition on the initial agonist receptor complex by calcium and activated phospholipase C, as well as receptor type-dependent self-enhanced behavior of the activated G(alpha) subunit. It is able to show simple periodic oscillations and periodic bursting, and it is the first model to display chaotic bursting in response to agonist stimulations. Moreover, our model offers a possible explanation for the differences in dynamic behavior observed in response to different agonists in hepatocytes.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ activates many processes, from mitochondrial metabolism to opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and apoptosis. However, there is considerable controversy regarding the free mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$](M)) levels that can be attained during cell activation or even in mitochondrial preparations. Studies using fluorescent dyes (rhod-2 or similar), have reported that phosphate precipitation precludes [Ca$^{2+}$](M) from increasing above 2-3 microM. Instead, using low-Ca$^{2+}$-affinity aequorin probes, we have measured [Ca$^{2+}$](M) values more than two orders of magnitude higher. We confirm here these values by making a direct in situ calibration of mitochondrial aequorin, and we show that a prolonged increase in [Ca$^{2+}$](M) to levels of 0.5-1mM was actually observed at any phosphate concentration (0-10mM) during continuous perfusion of 3.5-100 microM Ca$^{2+}$-buffers. In spite of this high and maintained (>10 min) [Ca$^{2+}$](M), mitochondria retained functionality and the [Ca$^{2+}$](M) drop induced by a protonophore was fully reversible. In addition, this high [Ca$^{2+}$](M) did not induce PTP opening unless additional activators (phenyl arsine oxide, PAO) were present. PAO induced a rapid, concentration-dependent and irreversible drop in [Ca$^{2+}$](M). In conclusion [Ca$^{2+}$](M) levels of 0.5-1mM can be reached and maintained for prolonged periods (>10 min) in phosphate-containing medium, and massive opening of PTP requires additional pore activators.},

abstract = {Calcium in ionic form is a second messenger connecting several input signals to several target processes in the cell. The question arises how one second messenger can transmit more than one signal simultaneously (bow-tie structure of signalling). Experimental data on calcium dynamics often show patterns of successive low-peak and high-peak oscillatory phases, known as bursting. Here, we propose that bursting calcium oscillations can perform the function of simultaneous transmission of two signals at physiological calcium concentrations, for example, by selective activation of two calcium-binding proteins. This differential regulation by periodic bursting is investigated in a theoretical model. The two proteins are assumed to be activated by calcium, and one of them is assumed to be subject to biphasic regulation due to additional inhibitory binding sites. To explore which characteristics of the complex signal could be responsible for independent regulation of low-peak activated and spike activated targets, different bursting patterns of simplified square pulses are applied. Depending on the change in the bursting pattern, one protein can be gradually activated at a constant level of the other protein's activity, or the two proteins can be activated simultaneously, or one protein can be activated while the other one is deactivated simultaneously. Thus, the two proteins can be regulated virtually independently.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, as our understanding of the various roles played by Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in development and differentiation has expanded, the challenge of imaging Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics within living cells, tissues, and whole animal systems has been extended to include specific signaling activity in organelles and non-membrane bound sub-cellular domains.

SCOPE OF REVIEW: In this review we outline how recent advances in genetics and molecular biology have contributed to improving and developing current bioluminescence-based Ca$^{2+}$ imaging techniques. Reporters can now be targeted to specific cell types, or indeed organelles or domains within a particular cell.

MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: These advances have contributed to our current understanding of the specificity and heterogeneity of developmental Ca$^{2+}$ signaling. The improvement in the spatial resolution that results from specifically targeting a Ca$^{2+}$ reporter has helped to reveal how a ubiquitous signaling messenger like Ca$^{2+}$ can regulate coincidental but different signaling events within an individual cell; a Ca$^{2+}$ signaling paradox that until now has been hard to explain.

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Techniques used to target specific reporters via genetic means will have applications beyond those of the Ca$^{2+}$ signaling field, and these will, therefore, make a significant contribution in extending our understanding of the signaling networks that regulate animal development. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Biochemical, biophysical and genetic approaches to intracellular calcium signalling.},

@article{Helle2013,
abstract = {Membrane-bound organelles are a wonderful evolutionary acquisition of the eukaryotic cell, allowing the segregation of sometimes incompatible biochemical reactions into specific compartments with tailored microenvironments. On the flip side, these isolating membranes that crowd the interior of the cell, constitute a hindrance to the diffusion of metabolites and information to all corners of the cell. To ensure coordination of cellular activities, cells use a network of contact sites between the membranes of different organelles. These membrane contact sites (MCSs) are domains where two membranes come to close proximity, typically less than 30nm. Such contacts create microdomains that favor exchange between two organelles. MCSs are established and maintained in durable or transient states by tethering structures, which keep the two membranes in proximity, but fusion between the membranes does not take place. Since the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the most extensive cellular membrane network, it is thus not surprising to find the ER involved in most MCSs within the cell. The ER contacts diverse compartments such as mitochondria, lysosomes, lipid droplets, the Golgi apparatus, endosomes and the plasma membrane. In this review, we will focus on the common organizing principles underlying the many MCSs found between the ER and virtually all compartments of the cell, and on how the ER establishes a network of MCSs for the trafficking of vital metabolites and information.

abstract = {Changes in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca$^{2+}$]i) have been continuously imaged during the interaction of the H-2Kb specific cytotoxic T cell lymphocyte (CTL) BM 3.3, with either the H-2Kb EL4.BU or the H-2Kk RDM4 cell lines. Activation of the CTLs by EL4.BU raises [Ca$^{2+}$]i to several hundred nanomolar in the CTL. Frequently [Ca$^{2+}$]i is preferentially elevated in the region of the CTL furthest from the site of target contact. These responses require external Ca$^{2+}$ suggesting that they are generated by the plasma membrane and not internal stores. Inappropriate targets such as RDM4 evoke no changes in [Ca$^{2+}$]i. Activation of the BM 3.3 CTL is followed by increases of [Ca$^{2+}$]i to several micromolar or higher in the EL4.BU targets. This massive increase can be mimicked by direct application of cytolytic granules isolated from rat natural killer cells. The increase in plasma membrane permeability is ion-specific since external Mn2+ can also readily enter target cells that have been 'hit', as evidenced by the rapid selective quenching of fura-2 in those targets. The flood of Ca$^{2+}$ into the target cell is followed by a leakage of the trapped fura-2. Since both processes continue after the CTL has disengaged, they provide a useful assay for the lethal hit. Furthermore, this technique can be used to follow complete cycles of CTL activation and lethal hit delivery, which under some circumstances can be as rapid as 6 min per cycle.},

abstract = {Cell function depends on the distribution of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors across the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Passage of metabolites through the OMM has been attributed to the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC), which can form a large conductance and permanently open a channel in lipid bilayers. However, recent data indicate that the transport of metabolites through the OMM is controlled in the cells. Recognizing that the bilayer studies had been commonly conducted at supraphysiological [Ca$^{2+}$] and [K$^+$], we determined the effect of Ca$^{2+}$ on VDAC activity. In liposomes, the purified VDAC displays Ca$^{2+}$-dependent control of the molecular cut-off size and shows Ca$^{2+}$-regulated Ca$^{2+}$ permeability in the physiological [Ca$^{2+}$] range. In bilayer experiments, at submicromolar [Ca$^{2+}$], the purified VDAC or isolated OMM does not show sustained large conductance but rather exhibits gating between a nonconducting state and various subconductance states. Ca$^{2+}$ addition causes a reversible increase in the conductance and may evoke channel opening to full conductance. Furthermore, single cell imaging data indicate that Ca$^{2+}$ may facilitate the cation and ATP transport across the OMM. Thus, the VDAC gating is dependent on the physiological concentrations of cations, allowing the OMM to control the passage of ions and some small molecules. The OMM barrier is likely to decrease during the calcium signal.},

abstract = {Calcium waves produced by bradykinin-induced inositol-1,4, 5-trisphosphate (InsP(3))-mediated release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been imaged in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. A model of this process was built using the "virtual cell," a general computational system for integrating experimental image, biochemical, and electrophysiological data. The model geometry was based on a cell for which the calcium wave had been experimentally recorded. The distributions of the relevant cellular components [InsP(3) receptor (InsP(3)R)], sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps, bradykinin receptors, and ER] were based on 3D confocal immunofluorescence images. Wherever possible, known biochemical and electrophysiological data were used to constrain the model. The simulation closely matched the spatial and temporal characteristics of the experimental calcium wave. Predictions on different patterns of calcium signals after InsP(3) uncaging or for different cell geometries were confirmed experimentally, thus helping to validate the model. Models in which the spatial distributions of key components are altered suggest that initiation of the wave in the center of the neurite derives from an interplay of soma-biased ER distribution and InsP(3) generation biased toward the neurite. Simulations demonstrate that mobile buffers (like the indicator fura-2) significantly delay initiation and lower the amplitude of the wave. Analysis of the role played by calcium diffusion indicated that the speed of the wave is only slightly dependent on the ability of calcium to diffuse to and activate neighboring InsP(3) receptor sites.},

In this study, we extend the previous work based on a statistical analysis of experimental Ca$^{2+}$ traces in isolated, hormone-stimulated hepatocytes and on stochastic simulations of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations based on the Gillespie's algorithm. Comparison of the coefficients of variation in the periods of experimental and simulated Ca$^{2+}$ spikes provides information about the clustering and the specific subtypes of the Ca$^{2+}$ channels. In hepatocytes coupled by gap junctions, the global perfusion with a hormone leads to successive Ca$^{2+}$ responses, giving the appearance of an intercellular wave. Statistical analysis of experimental Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in coupled hepatocytes confirms that this coordinated Ca$^{2+}$ spiking corresponds to a phase wave but suggests the existence of an additional coupling mechanism.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels catalyse rapid, highly selective influx of Ca$^{2+}$ into cells despite a 70-fold higher extracellular concentration of Na(+). How CaV channels solve this fundamental biophysical problem remains unclear. Here we report physiological and crystallographic analyses of a calcium selectivity filter constructed in the homotetrameric bacterial NaV channel NaVAb. Our results reveal interactions of hydrated Ca$^{2+}$ with two high-affinity Ca$^{2+}$-binding sites followed by a third lower-affinity site that would coordinate Ca$^{2+}$ as it moves inward. At the selectivity filter entry, Site 1 is formed by four carboxyl side chains, which have a critical role in determining Ca$^{2+}$ selectivity. Four carboxyls plus four backbone carbonyls form Site 2, which is targeted by the blocking cations Cd(2+) and Mn(2+), with single occupancy. The lower-affinity Site 3 is formed by four backbone carbonyls alone, which mediate exit into the central cavity. This pore architecture suggests a conduction pathway involving transitions between two main states with one or two hydrated Ca$^{2+}$ ions bound in the selectivity filter and supports a 'knock-off' mechanism of ion permeation through a stepwise-binding process. The multi-ion selectivity filter of our CaVAb model establishes a structural framework for understanding the mechanisms of ion selectivity and conductance by vertebrate CaV channels.},

abstract = {Cytosolic calcium oscillations occur in a wide variety of cells and are involved in different cellular functions. We describe these calcium oscillations by a mathematical model based on the putative electrophysiological properties of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The salient features of our membrane model are calcium-dependent calcium channels and calcium pumps in the ER membrane, constant entry of calcium into the cytosol, calcium dependent removal from the cytosol, and buffering by cytoplasmic calcium binding proteins. Numerical integration of the model allows us to study the fluctuations in the cytosolic calcium concentration, the ER membrane potential, and the concentration of free calcium binding sites on a calcium binding protein. The model demonstrates the physiological features necessary for calcium oscillations and suggests that the level of calcium flux into the cytosol controls the frequency and amplitude of oscillations. The model also suggests that the level of buffering affects the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations. The model is supported by experiments indirectly measuring cytosolic calcium by calcium-induced chloride currents in Xenopus oocytes as well as cytosolic calcium oscillations observed in other preparations.},

abstract = {Astrocytes exhibit oscillations and waves of Ca$^{2+}$ ions within their cytosol and it appears that this behavior helps facilitate the astrocyte's interaction with its environment, including its neighboring neurons. Often changes in the oscillatory behavior are initiated by an external stimulus such as glutamate, recently however, it has been observed that oscillations are also initiated spontaneously. We propose here a mathematical model of how spontaneous Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations arise in astrocytes. This model uses the calcium-induced calcium release and inositol cross-coupling mechanisms coupled with a receptor-independent method for producing inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate as the heart of the model. By computationally mimicking experimental constraints we have found that this model provides results that are qualitatively similar to experiment.},

abstract = {The permeability transition pore (PT-pore) is a multi-component protein aggregate in mitochondria that comprises factors in the inner as well as in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This complex has two functions: firstly, it regulates the integration of oxidative phosphorylation into the cellular energy household and secondly, it induces cell death when converted into an unspecific channel. The latter causes a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential and activates a chain of events that culminate in the demise of the cell. It has been controversial for some time whether the PT-pore is causative for or only amplifies a signal of cell death but novel results confirm a central role of this protein complex for cell death induction. While a considerable body of data exist on its subunit composition, recent genetic knock-out experiments suggest that the identity of the core factors of the PT-pore is still unresolved. Moreover, accumulating evidence point to a much more complex composition of this protein complex than anticipated. Here, we review the current knowledge of its subunit composition, the evidence of a role in cell death, and we propose a model for the activation of the PT-pore for cell death.},

Selecting rate constants to fit key kinetic and equilibrium data, we find that the model reproduces a variety of in vivo and in vitro experiments. In combination with Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase activity for Ca$^{2+}$ uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum, the model leads to cytoplasmic oscillations in Ca$^{2+}$ concentration at fixed IP3 concentration and only a single pool of releasable Ca$^{2+}$, the endoplasmic reticulum. Incorporation of a positive-feedback mechanism of Ca$^{2+}$ on IP3 production by phospholipase C enriches the properties of the oscillations and leads to oscillations in Ca$^{2+}$ concentration accompanied by oscillations in IP3 concentration. We discuss the possible significance of these results for the interpretation of experiments.},

abstract = {Although it has been known for over three decades that mitochondria are endowed with a complex array of Ca$^{2+}$ transporters and that key enzymes of mitochondrial metabolism are regulated by Ca$^{2+}$, the possibility that physiological stimuli that raise the [Ca$^{2+}$] of the cytoplasm could trigger major mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake has long been considered unlikely, based on the low affinity of the mitochondrial transporters and the limited amplitude of the cytoplasmic [Ca$^{2+}$] rises. The direct measurement of mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] with highly selective probes has led to a complete reversion of this view, by demonstrating that, after cell stimulation, the cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ signal is always paralleled by a much larger rise in [Ca$^{2+}$] in the mitochondrial matrix. This observation has rejuvenated the study of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport and novel, unexpected results have altered long-standing dogmas in the field of calcium signalling. Here we focus on four main topics: (i) the current knowledge of the functional properties of the Ca$^{2+}$ transporters and of the thermodynamic constraints under which they operate; (ii) the occurrence of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake in living cells and the key role of local signalling routes between the mitochondria and the Ca$^{2+}$ sources; (iii) the physiological consequences of Ca$^{2+}$ transport for both mitochondrial function and the modulation of the cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ signal; and (iv) evidence that alterations of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ signalling may occur in pathophysiological conditions.},

abstract = {The neuronal Ca$^{2+}$ signal is induced by a rise in the intracellular free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]i), and is thought to be important for higher brain function. Dynamic changes in [Ca$^{2+}$]i are affected by the spatial distributions of various Ca$^{2+}$-increasing molecules (channels and receptors). The ryanodine receptor (RyR) is an intracellular channel through which Ca$^{2+}$ is released from intracellular stores. To define the contribution of neuronal Ca$^{2+}$ signaling via the RyR channel, we examined RyR type-specific gene expression in rabbit brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The neuronal RyR was composed of three distinct types, two types dominant in skeletal (sRyR) and cardiac (cRyR) muscle, respectively, and a novel brain type (bRyR). sRyR was distinguished by its high level of expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells. cRyR was predominantly expressed throughout nearly the entire brain, and was characterized by its markedly high level of expression in the olfactory nerve layer, layer VI of the cerebral cortex, the dentate gyrus, cerebellar granule cells, the motor trigeminal nucleus, and the facial nucleus. bRyR expression was the least widely distributed throughout the brain, and was high in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer, caudate, putamen, and dorsal thalamus. This investigation demonstrates that the heterogeneous distribution of neuronal RyRs may be implicated in distinct Ca$^{2+}$-associated brain functions. Moreover, it should be noted that cRyR, a typical CICR channel, is distributed widely throughout the brain, suggesting that in a variety of cell types, the amplification of neuronal Ca$^{2+}$ signals is functionally accompanied by a rise in [Ca$^{2+}$]i, such as Ca$^{2+}$ influx stimulated by neuronal activity. This widespread distribution of the neuronal RyR family indicates that Ca$^{2+}$ signals via the intracellular stores should be considered in studies of neuronal Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics.},

Long period oscillations can be perceived as nucleation phenomenon and can be observed for a large variety of single channel dynamics. Their period depends on the geometric characteristics of the cluster array. Short periods are in the range of the time scale of channel dynamics.

abstract = {Major progress has been made in elucidating the calcium release mechanism involved in excitation-contraction coupling. The ryanodine receptor of sarcoplasmic reticulum has been isolated and found to be morphologically identical to the foot structure, which is involved in the junctional association of terminal cisternae with the transverse tubule. The foot structure also contains the calcium release channel itself. For this reason, we refer to the foot structure as the junctional channel complex (JCC). The JCC consists of an oligomer of a single high molecular weight protein. Although progress has been made in characterizing important aspects of the structure and function of the JCC, further understanding of the JCC protein subunit awaits the molecular cloning of the JCC. We report on the isolation of cDNA clones encoding portions of the JCC from rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle and its tissue distribution and expression. The large size and lack of solubility of the JCC protein posed particular challenges to cloning this molecule. Among these was the necessity to develop techniques for partially digesting the JCC protein subunit with endoproteases in the presence of detergent. With this approach we obtained partial amino acid sequences from regions of the JCC and designed oligonucleotide primers and probes to synthesize and screen cDNA libraries. The rabbit skeletal muscle JCC mRNA encodes an approximately 16-kilobase mRNA present in skeletal, heart, and aortic smooth muscle, as determined by RNA blot analysis with a 700-base-pair cDNA probe. Whereas the JCC mRNA appears to be relatively abundant in adult rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle, it is much less abundant in heart and smooth muscle. The JCC mRNA in BC3H1 (a myoblast cell line) is reversibly regulated by growth factors in a manner similar to muscle-specific contractile protein genes.},

abstract = {Free [Ca$^{2+}$] in agonist-sensitive internal stores of single intact cells was measured in situ in order to examine the role of [Ca$^{2+}$] in modulating the store refilling process. BHK-21 fibroblasts were loaded with the low-affinity fluorescent calcium indicator mag-fura-2-AM such that >80\% of the dye was trapped in organelles, where it reported [Ca$^{2+}$] changes solely in an agonist- and thapsigargin-sensitive internal store. The rates of store reloading following stimulation by 100 nM bradykinin were essentially unchanged when cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] was clamped to resting values with BAPTA-AM. In control cells, recharging of stores totally depended on the presence of external Ca$^{2+}$, but pre-loading the cells with BAPTA-AM permitted efficient refilling in Ca$^{2+}$-free, EGTA-containing external medium. Our results show: (i) Ca$^{2+}$ stores normally are recharged by Ca$^{2+}$ which must first transit the cytoplasm; (ii) an elevation in cytoplasmic [Ca$^{2+}$] is not required to replenish Ca$^{2+}$ stores; (iii) the activation of the plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$ pump during the Ca$^{2+}$ spike ordinarily results in complete extrusion of released Ca$^{2+}$; and (iv) the buffering capacity of the cytoplasm is an essential component of the store refilling process. An interesting finding was that acute treatment of cells with BAPTA-AM activated capacitative Ca$^{2+}$ entry at the plasma membrane, due to its efficient hydrolysis in the stores, and the ensuing decrease in the endoplasmic reticulum [Ca$^{2+}$].},

abstract = {Skeletal muscle stores Ca²(+) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and releases it to initiate contraction, but the concentration of luminal Ca²(+) in the SR ([Ca²(+)](SR)) and the amount that is released by physiological or pharmacological stimulation has been difficult to measure. Here we present a novel, yet simple and direct, method that provides the first quantitative estimates of static content and dynamic changes in [Ca²(+)](SR) in mammalian skeletal muscle, to our knowledge. The method uses fluo-5N loaded into the SR of single, mammalian skeletal muscle cells (murine flexor digitorum brevis myofibers) and confocal imaging to detect and calibrate the signals. Using this method, we have determined that [Ca²(+)](SR, free) is 390 $\mu$M. 4-Chloro-m-cresol, an activator of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, reduces [Ca²(+)](SR, free) to ∼8 $\mu$M, when values are corrected for background fluorescence from cytoplasmic pools of dye. Prolonged electrical stimulation (10 s) at 50 Hz releases 88\% of the SR Ca²(+) content, whereas stimulation at 1 Hz (10 s) releases only 20\%. Our results lay the foundation for molecular modeling of the dynamics of luminal SR Ca²(+) and for future studies of the role of SR Ca²(+) in healthy and diseased mammalian muscle.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence indicates that mitochondria are locally coupled to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca$^{2+}$ release in myoblasts and to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca$^{2+}$ release in differentiated muscle fibers in order to regulate cytoplasmic calcium dynamics and match metabolism with cell activity. However, the mechanism of the developmental transition from ER to SR coupling remains unclear. We have studied mitochondrial sensing of IP3 receptor (IP3R)- and ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ signals in H9c2 myoblasts and differentiating myotubes, as well as the attendant changes in mitochondrial morphology. Mitochondria in myoblasts were largely elongated, luminally connected and relatively few in number, whereas the myotubes were densely packed with globular mitochondria that displayed limited luminal continuity. Vasopressin, an IP3-linked agonist, evoked a large cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ ([Ca$^{2+}$]c) increase in myoblasts, whereas it elicited a smaller response in myotubes. Conversely, RyR-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release induced by caffeine, was not observed in myoblasts, but triggered a large [Ca$^{2+}$]c signal in myotubes. Both the IP3R and the RyR-mediated [Ca$^{2+}$]c rise was closely associated with a mitochondrial matrix Ca$^{2+}$ ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) signal. Every myotube that showed a [Ca$^{2+}$]c spike also displayed a [Ca$^{2+}$]m response. Addition of IP3 to permeabilized myoblasts and caffeine to permeabilized myotubes also resulted in a rapid [Ca$^{2+}$]m rise, indicating that Ca$^{2+}$ was delivered via local coupling of the ER/SR and mitochondria. Thus, as RyRs are expressed during muscle differentiation, the local connection between RyR and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake sites also appears. When RyR1 was exogenously introduced to myoblasts by overexpression, the [Ca$^{2+}$]m signal appeared together with the [Ca$^{2+}$]c signal, however the mitochondrial morphology remained unchanged. Thus, RyR expression alone is sufficient to induce the steps essential for their alignment with mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake sites, whereas the mitochondrial proliferation and reshaping utilize either downstream or alternative pathways.},

@article{Tang1996,
abstract = {Calcium (Ca) dynamics are incorporated into a mathematical model of the principal cell in the cortical collecting tubule developed earlier in Strieter et al. (1992a. Am. J Physiol. 263:F1063-1075). The Ca components are modeled after the Othmer-Tang model for IP(3)-sensitive calcium channels (1993, in Experimental and Theoretical Advances in Biological Pattern Formation, 295-319). There are IP(3)-sensitive Ca channels and ATP-driven pumps on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium enters the cell passively down its electrochemical gradient. A Ca pump and Na/Ca exchange in the basolateral membrane are responsible for the extrusion of cytoplasmic calcium. Na/Ca exchange can also operate in reverse mode to transport Ca into the cell. Regulatory effects of cytoplasmic Ca on the apical Na channels are modeled after experimental data that indicate apical Na permeability varies inversely with cytoplasmic Ca concentration. Numerical results on changes in intracellular Ca caused by decreasing NaCl in the bath and the lumen are similar to those from experiments in Bourdeau and Lau (1990. Am. J Physiol. 258:F1497-1503). This match of simulation and experiment requires the synergistic action of the Na/Ca exchanger and the Ca regulated apical Na permeability. In a homogeneous medium, cytoplasmic Ca becomes oscillatory when extracellular Na is severely decreased, as observed in experiments of cultured principal cells (Koster, H., C. van Os and R. Bindels. 1993. Kidney Int.43:828-836). This essentially pathological situation arises because the hyperpolarization of membrane potential caused by Na-free medium increases Ca influx into the cell, while the Na/Ca exchanger is inactivated by the low extracellular Na and can no longer move Ca out of the cell effectively. The raising of the total amount of intracellular Ca induces oscillatory Ca movement between the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum. Ca homeostasis is investigated under the condition of severe extracellular Ca variations. As extracellular Ca is decreased, Ca regulation is greatly impaired if Ca does not regulate apical ionic transport. The simulations indicate that the Na/Ca exchanger alone has only limited regulatory capacity. The Ca regulated apical sodium or potassium permeability are essential for regulation of cytoplasmic Ca in the principal cell of the cortical collecting tubule.},

abstract = {Cytosolic calcium acts as both a coagonist and an inhibitor of the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-gated Ca channel, resulting in a bell-shaped Ca dependence of channel activity (Bezprozvanny, I., J. Watras, and B.E. Ehrlich. 1991. Nature. 351:751-754; Finch, E.A., T.J. Turner, and S.M. Goldin. 1991. Science. 252: 443-446; Iino, M. 1990. J. Gen. Physiol. 95:1103-1122). The ability of Ca to inhibit channel activity, however, varies dramatically depending on InsP3 concentration (Combettes, L., Z. Hannaert-Merah, J.F. Coquil, C. Rousseau, M. Claret, S. Swillens, and P. Champeil. 1994. J. Biol. Chem. 269:17561-17571; Kaftan, E.J., B.E. Ehrlich, and J. Watras. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. 110:529-538). In the present report, we have extended the characterization of the effect of cytosolic Ca on both InsP3 binding and InsP3-gated channel kinetics, and incorporated these data into a mathematical model capable of simulating channel kinetics. We found that cytosolic Ca increased the Kd of InsP3 binding approximately 3.5-fold, but did not influence the maximal number of binding sites. The ability of Ca to decrease InsP3 binding is consistent with the rightward shift in the bell-shaped Ca dependence of InsP3-gated Ca channel activity. High InsP3 concentrations are able to overcome the Ca-dependent inhibition of channel activity, apparently due to a low affinity InsP3 binding site (Kaftan, E.J., B.E. Ehrlich, and J. Watras. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. 110:529-538). Constants from binding analyses and channel activity determinations were used to develop a mathematical model that fits the complex Ca-dependent regulation of the type 1 InsP3-gated Ca channel. This model accurately simulated both steady state data (channel open probability and InsP3 binding) and kinetic data (channel activity and open time distributions), and yielded testable predictions with regard to the regulation of this intracellular Ca channel. Information gained from these analyses, and our current molecular model of this Ca channel, will be important for understanding the basis and regulation of intracellular Ca waves and oscillations in intact cells.},

Here we present crystal structures of the zebrafish P2X(4) receptor in its closed, resting state. The chalice-shaped, trimeric receptor is knit together by subunit-subunit contacts implicated in ion channel gating and receptor assembly. Extracellular domains, rich in beta-strands, have large acidic patches that may attract cations, through fenestrations, to vestibules near the ion channel. In the transmembrane pore, the 'gate' is defined by an approximately 8 A slab of protein. We define the location of three non-canonical, intersubunit ATP-binding sites, and suggest that ATP binding promotes subunit rearrangement and ion channel opening.},

abstract = {In many cell types, asynchronous or synchronous oscillations in the concentration of intracellular free calcium occur in adjacent cells that are coupled by gap junctions. Such oscillations are believed to underlie oscillatory intercellular calcium waves in some cell types, and thus it is important to understand how they occur and are modified by intercellular coupling. Using a previous model of intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells, this article explores the effects of coupling two cells with a simple linear diffusion term. Depending on the concentration of a signal molecule, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, coupling two identical cells by diffusion can give rise to synchronized in-phase oscillations, as well as different-amplitude in-phase oscillations and same-amplitude antiphase oscillations. Coupling two nonidentical cells leads to more complex behaviors such as cascades of period doubling and multiply periodic solutions. This study is a first step towards understanding the role and significance of the diffusion of calcium through gap junctions in the coordination of oscillatory calcium waves in a variety of cell types.

There are at least 17 syt isoforms in mammals, all with tandem C-terminal C2 domains with highly variable capacities for Ca$^{2+}$ binding. Many syts play roles in neurotransmitter release or hormone secretion or both, and a growing body of work supports a role for some syts as Ca$^{2+}$ sensors of exocytosis. Work in many types of endocrine cells has documented the presence of a number of syt isoforms on dense-core vesicles containing various hormones. Syts can influence the kinetics of exocytotic fusion pores and the choice of release mode between kiss-and-run and full-fusion. Vesicles harboring different syt isoforms can preferentially undergo distinct modes of exocytosis with different forms of stimulation. The diverse properties of syt isoforms enable these proteins to shape Ca$^{2+}$ sensing in endocrine cells, thus contributing to the regulation of hormone release and the organization of complex endocrine functions.},

abstract = {Allosteric binding of calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) controls channel gating within IP3R. Here, we present biochemical and electron microscopic evidence of Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive structural changes in the three-dimensional structure of type 1 IP3R (IP3R1). Low concentrations of Ca$^{2+}$ and high concentrations of Sr2+ and Ba2+ were shown to be effective for the limited proteolysis of IP3R1, but Mg2+ had no effect on the proteolysis. The electron microscopy and the limited proteolysis consistently demonstrated that the effective concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ for conformational changes in IP3R1 was <10(-7) m and that the IP3 scarcely affected the conformational states. The structure of IP3R1 without Ca$^{2+}$, as reconstructed by three-dimensional electron microscopy, had a "mushroom-like" appearance consisting of a large square-shaped head and a small channel domain linked by four thin bridges. The projection image of the "head-to-head" assembly comprising two particles confirmed the mushroom-like side view. The "windmill-like" form of IP3R1 with Ca$^{2+}$ also contains the four bridges connecting from the IP3-binding domain toward the channel domain. These data suggest that the Ca$^{2+}$-specific conformational change structurally regulates the IP3-triggered channel opening within IP3R1.},

abstract = {Loading of HT29 cells with the Ca$^{2+}$ dye fura-2/AM resulted in an nonhomogeneous intracellular distribution of the dye. Cellular compartments with high fura-2 concentrations were identified by correlation with mitochondrial markers, cellular autofluorescence induced by UV, and dynamic measurement of autofluorescence after inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. Stimulation with carbachol (10(-4) mol/liter) increased cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ activity ([Ca$^{2+}$]c, [Ca$^{2+}$]n, and [Ca$^{2+}$]m, respectively) measured by UV confocal and conventional imaging. Similar results were obtained with a prototype two-photon microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) allowing for fura-2 excitation. The increase of [Ca$^{2+}$]m lagged behind that of [Ca$^{2+}$]c and [Ca$^{2+}$]n by 10-20 s, and after removing the agonist, [Ca$^{2+}$]m also decreased with a delay. A strong increase of [Ca$^{2+}$]m occurred only when a certain threshold of [Ca$^{2+}$]c (around 1 micromol/liter) was exceeded. In a very similar way, ATP, neurotensin, and thapsigargin increased [Ca$^{2+}$]c and [Ca$^{2+}$]m. Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhyrdrazone reversibly reduced the increase of [Ca$^{2+}$]m. The source of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ increase had intra- and extracellular components, as revealed by experiments in low extracellular Ca$^{2+}$. We conclude that agonist-induced Ca$^{2+}$ signals are transduced into mitochondria. 1) Mitochondria could serve as a Ca$^{2+}$ sink, 2) mitochondria could allow the modulation of [Ca$^{2+}$]c and [Ca$^{2+}$]n signals, and 3) [Ca$^{2+}$]m may serve as a stimulatory metabolic signal when a cell is highly stimulated.},

abstract = {We continue our development of a kinetic model of bursting electrical activity in the pancreatic beta-cell (J. Keizer and G. Magnus. Biophys. J. 56: 229-242, 1989), including the influence of Ca$^{2+}$ handling by the mitochondria. Our minimal model of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling [G. Magnus and J. Keizer. Am. J. Physiol. 273 (Cell Physiol. 42): C717-C733, 1997] is expanded to include the D-glucose dependence of the rate of production of mitochondrial reducing equivalents. The Ca$^{2+}$ dependence of the mitochondrial dehydrogenases, which is also included in the model, plays only a small role in the simulations, since the dehydrogenases appear to be maximally activated when D-glucose concentrations are sufficient to produce bursting. A previous model of ionic currents in the plasma membrane is updated using a recent experimental characterization of the dependence of the conductance of the ATP-sensitive K$^+$ (KATP) current on adenine nucleotides. The resulting whole cell model is complex, involving 12 dynamic variables that couple Ca$^{2+}$ handling in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria with electrical activity in the plasma and inner mitochondrial membranes. Simulations with the whole cell model give rise to bursting electrical activity similar to that seen in pancreatic islets and clusters of pancreatic beta-cells. The full D-glucose dose response of electrical activity is obtained if the cytosolic rate of ATP hydrolysis is a sigmoidal function of glucose. The simulations give the correct shape, period, and phase of the associated oscillations in cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$, predict that the conductance of the KATP current oscillates out of phase with electrical activity [as recently observed in ob/ob mice (O. Larsson, H. Kindmark, R. Br\"{a}nstrom, B. Fredholm, and P.-O. Berggren. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 5161-5165, 1996)], and make other novel predictions. In this model, bursting results because Ca$^{2+}$ uptake into mitochondria during the active phase reduces the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, reducing the rate of production of ATP, which in turn activates the KATP current and repolarizes the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {The effects of intravenous (i.v.) anaesthetics on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-induced transients in intracellular free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$](i)) and membrane currents were investigated in neonatal rat intracardiac neurons. In fura-2-loaded neurons, nAChR activation evoked a transient increase in [Ca$^{2+}$](I), which was inhibited reversibly and selectively by clinically relevant concentrations of thiopental. The half-maximal concentration for thiopental inhibition of nAChR-induced [Ca$^{2+}$](i) transients was 28 microM, close to the estimated clinical EC(50) (clinically relevant (half-maximal) effective concentration) of thiopental. In fura-2-loaded neurons, voltage clamped at -60 mV to eliminate any contribution of voltage-gated Ca$^{2+}$ channels, thiopental (25 microM) simultaneously inhibited nAChR-induced increases in [Ca$^{2+}$](i) and peak current amplitudes. Thiopental inhibited nAChR-induced peak current amplitudes in dialysed whole-cell recordings by approximately 40\% at -120, -80 and -40 mV holding potential, indicating that the inhibition is voltage independent. The barbiturate, pentobarbital and the dissociative anaesthetic, ketamine, used at clinical EC(50) were also shown to inhibit nAChR-induced increases in [Ca$^{2+}$](i) by approximately 40\%. Thiopental (25 muM) did not inhibit caffeine-, muscarine- or ATP-evoked increases in [Ca$^{2+}$](i), indicating that inhibition of Ca$^{2+}$ release from internal stores via either ryanodine receptor or inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor channels is unlikely. Depolarization-activated Ca$^{2+}$ channel currents were unaffected in the presence of thiopental (25 microM), pentobarbital (50 microM) and ketamine (10 microM). In conclusion, i.v. anaesthetics inhibit nAChR-induced currents and [Ca$^{2+}$](i) transients in intracardiac neurons by binding to nAChRs and thereby may contribute to changes in heart rate and cardiac output under clinical conditions.},

abstract = {Glucagon induces a slight Ca$^{2+}$ efflux when administered to the perfused rat liver. However, the hormone promotes rapid and significant Ca$^{2+}$ influx after the prior administration of 2, 5-di(t-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (BHQ), an agent that promotes Ca$^{2+}$ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The concentrations of glucagon that promote Ca$^{2+}$ influx are similar to those that promote glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in isolated hepatocytes. The permeable analogue of cAMP, but not that of cGMP, is able to duplicate the Ca$^{2+}$-mobilizing effects of glucagon. The influx of Ca$^{2+}$ into liver is blocked by Ni2+. Administration of sodium azide, an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport, also blocks the BHQ plus glucagon-induced Ca$^{2+}$ influx and this is reversed when azide administration is terminated. The actions of azide are evident within 60 s after administration or withdrawal, and also occur when either oligomycin or fructose is co-administered; this provides evidence for an effect of azide independent of cellular ATP depletion. Measurement of total calcium in mitochondria that were isolated rapidly from perfused livers after the combined administration of glucagon and BHQ confirmed that large quantities of extracellular Ca$^{2+}$ had entered these organelles. These experiments provide evidence that in the perfused rat liver the artificial emptying of the ER Ca$^{2+}$ pool allows glucagon to promote rapid and sustained Ca$^{2+}$ influx that seems to terminate in mitochondria.},

abstract = {Bcl-xL is a member of the Bcl-2 protein family, which regulates apoptosis. Preparation of recombinant rat Bcl-xL yielded two forms, one deamidated at -Asn-Gly- sequences to produce isoaspartates and the other not deamidated. The crystal structures of the two forms show that they both adopt an essentially identical backbone structure which resembles the fold of human Bcl-xL: three layers of two alpha-helices each, capped at one end by two short helices. Both forms have a long disordered region, which contains the potential deamidation sites. The molecular structure exhibits a low level of interhelical interactions, the presence of three cavities, and a notable hydrophobic cleft surrounded by walls rich in basic residues. These unique structural features may be favorable for its accommodation into membranes or for possible rearrangement to modulate homo-/heterodimerization. Homology modeling of Bcl-2 and Bax, based on the Bcl-xL structure, suggests that Bax has the strongest potential for membrane insertion. Furthermore, we found a possible interface for interaction with non-Bcl-2 family member proteins, such as CED-4 homologues.},

The InsP3R is a calcium-selective cation channel whose gating is regulated not only by InsP3, but by other ligands as well, in particular cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$. Over the last decade, detailed quantitative studies of InsP3R channel function and its regulation by ligands and interacting proteins have provided new insights into a remarkable richness of channel regulation and of the structural aspects that underlie signal transduction and permeation.

abstract = {Sperm-specific phospholipase C $\zeta$ (PLC$\zeta$) activates embryo development by triggering intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in mammalian eggs indistinguishable from those at fertilization. Somatic PLC isozymes generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release by hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) in the plasma membrane. Here we examine the subcellular source of PI(4,5)P(2) targeted by sperm PLC$\zeta$ in mouse eggs. By monitoring egg plasma membrane PI(4,5)P(2) with a green fluorescent protein-tagged PH domain, we show that PLC$\zeta$ effects minimal loss of PI(4,5)P(2) from the oolemma in contrast to control PLC$\delta$1, despite the much higher potency of PLC$\zeta$ in eliciting Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. Specific depletion of this PI(4,5)P(2) pool by plasma membrane targeting of an inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (Inp54p) blocked PLC$\delta$1-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations but not those stimulated by PLC$\zeta$ or sperm. Immunolocalization of PI(4,5)P(2), PLC$\zeta$, and catalytically inactive PLC$\zeta$ (ciPLC$\zeta$) revealed their colocalization to distinct vesicular structures inside the egg cortex. These vesicles displayed decreased PI(4,5)P(2) after PLC$\zeta$ injection. Targeted depletion of vesicular PI(4,5)P(2) by expression of ciPLC$\zeta$-fused Inp54p inhibited the Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations triggered by PLC$\zeta$ or sperm but failed to affect those mediated by PLC$\delta$1. In contrast to somatic PLCs, our data indicate that sperm PLC$\zeta$ induces Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization by hydrolyzing internal PI(4,5)P(2) stores, suggesting that the mechanism of mammalian fertilization comprises a novel phosphoinositide signaling pathway.},

abstract = {Calcium is a key ion and is known to mediate signalling pathways between cytosol and mitochondria and modulate mitochondrial energy metabolism. To gain a quantitative, biophysical understanding of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ regulation, we developed a thermodynamically balanced model of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling and bioenergetics by integrating kinetic models of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter (CU), Na(+)-Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger (NCE), and Na(+)-H(+) exchanger (NHE) into an existing computational model of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Kinetic flux expressions for the CU, NCE and NHE were developed and individually parameterized based on independent data sets on flux rates measured in purified mitochondria. While available data support a wide range of possible values for the overall activity of the CU in cardiac and liver mitochondria, even at the highest estimated values, the Ca$^{2+}$ current through the CU does not have a significant effect on mitochondrial membrane potential. This integrated model was then used to analyse additional data on the dynamics and steady-states of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ governed by mitochondrial CU and NCE. Our analysis of the data on the time course of matrix free [Ca$^{2+}$] in respiring mitochondria purified from rabbit heart with addition of different levels of Na(+) to the external buffer medium (with the CU blocked) with two separate models--one with a 2:1 stoichiometry and the other with a 3:1 stoichiometry for the NCE--supports the hypothesis that the NCE is electrogenic with a stoichiometry of 3:1. This hypothesis was further tested by simulating an additional independent data set on the steady-state variations of matrix free [Ca$^{2+}$] with respect to the variations in external free [Ca$^{2+}$] in purified respiring mitochondria from rat heart to show that only the 3:1 stoichiometry model predictions are consistent with the data. Based on these analyses, it is concluded that the mitochondrial NCE is electrogenic with a stoichiometry of 3:1.},

abstract = {Studies on control of fluid secretion by an insect salivary gland led to the discovery of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and its role in calcium signalling. Many cell stimuli act on receptors that are coupled to phospholipase C that hydrolyses phosphatidylinosol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to release IP3 to the cytosol. IP3 receptors located on the endoplasmic reticulum respond to this elevation of IP3 by releasing Ca$^{2+}$, which is often organized into characteristic spatial (elementary events and waves) and temporal (Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations) patterns. This IP3/Ca$^{2+}$ pathway is a remarkably versatile signalling system that has been adapted to control processes as diverse as fertilization, proliferation, contraction, cell metabolism, vesicle and fluid secretion and information processing in neuronal cells.},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane is facilitated by transporters having four distinct sets of characteristics as well as through the Ca$^{2+}$-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). There are two modes of inward transport, referred to as the Ca$^{2+}$uniporter and the rapid mode or RaM. There are also two distinct mechanisms mediating outward transport, which are not associated with the PTP, referred to as the Na(+)-dependent and the Na(+)-independent Ca$^{2+}$efflux mechanisms. Several important functions have been proposed for these mechanisms, including control of the metabolic rate for cellular energy (ATP) production, modulation of the amplitude and shape of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$transients, and induction of apoptosis through release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial inter membrane space into the cytosolic space. The goals of this review are to survey the literature describing the characteristics of the mechanisms of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$transport and their proposed physiological functions, emphasizing the more recent contributions, and to consider how the observed characteristics of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$transport mechanisms affect our understanding of their functions.},

abstract = {In many cell types, transfer of Ca$^{2+}$ released via ryanodine receptors (RyR) to the mitochondrial matrix is locally supported by high [Ca$^{2+}$] microdomains at close contacts between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and mitochondria. Here we studied whether the close contacts were secured via direct physical coupling in cardiac muscle using isolated rat heart mitochondria (RHMs). "Immuno-organelle chemistry" revealed RyR2 and calsequestrin-positive SR particles associated with mitochondria in both crude and Percoll-purified "heavy" mitochondrial fractions (cRHM and pRHM), to a smaller extent in the latter one. Mitochondria-associated vesicles were also visualized by electron microscopy in the RHMs. Western blot analysis detected greatly reduced presence of SR markers (calsequestrin, SERCA2a, and phospholamban) in pRHM, suggesting that the mitochondria-associated particles represented a small subfraction of the SR. Fluorescence calcium imaging in rhod2-loaded cRHM revealed mitochondrial matrix [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$](m)) responses to caffeine-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release that were prevented when thapsigargin was added to predeplete the SR or by mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake inhibitors. Importantly, caffeine failed to increase [Ca$^{2+}$] in the large volume of the incubation medium, suggesting that local Ca$^{2+}$ transfer between the SR particles and mitochondria mediated the [Ca$^{2+}$](m) signal. Despite the substantially reduced SR presence, pRHM still displayed a caffeine-induced [Ca$^{2+}$](m) rise comparable with the one recorded in cRHM. Thus, a relatively small fraction of the total SR is physically coupled and transfers Ca$^{2+}$ locally to the mitochondria in cardiac muscle. The transferred Ca$^{2+}$ stimulates dehydrogenase activity and affects mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, indicating the broad significance of the physical coupling in mitochondrial function.},

abstract = {We have used whole cell patch clamp procedures to investigate the inhibition of L-type calcium channel currents in guinea pig ventricular cells by the permanently charged dihydropyridine (DHP)compound UK-118,434-05 (quaternary amlodipine, QA). The location of the charge group of this drug molecule is approximately three times closer to the active DHP moiety than is the case for SDZ-207-180, the only other previously-investigated quaternary DHP molecule. Like SDZ-207-180, QA inhibits channel activity only by external application, consistent with an externally, but not internally, accessible binding site, and once blocked, channels do not recover availability by membrane hyperpolarization independent of extracellular pH. However inhibition by QA occurs at roughly 20 x lower potency than comparable inhibition by SDZ-207-180. Low affinity binding to the DHP binding site was confirmed directly with radioligand binding. The permanently charged amlodipine derivative inhibited radioligand DHP binding in partially purified rabbit skeletal muscle transverse tubule membranes with a pseudo-Hill slope close to unity and an IC50 value of 4.2 +/- 0.6 microM. These results indicate that the characteristically slow pharmacokinetics of tertiary amlodipine are due to the unusually stable inhibition of L-channels caused by the ionized fraction of drug molecules. Furthermore, because the distance between the ionized head group and the DHP moiety is so short, the low affinity binding and channel inhibition by QA suggests that the DHP binding site is not on the extracellular domain of the L-channel alpha 1 subunit, but instead must reside within the bilayer or channel pore at a location closer to the extracellular rather than the intracellular face of the membrane.},

abstract = {Many studies of Ca$^{2+}$ signaling use PC12 cells, yet the balance of Ca$^{2+}$ clearance mechanisms in these cells is unknown. We used pharmacological inhibition of Ca$^{2+}$ transporters to characterize Ca$^{2+}$ clearance after depolarizations in both undifferentiated and nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells. Sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{2+}$ ATPase (SERCA), plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$ ATPase (PMCA), and Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger (NCX) account for almost all Ca$^{2+}$ clearance in both cell states, with NCX and PMCA making the greatest contributions. Any contribution of mitochondrial uniporters is small. The ATP pool in differentiated cells was much more labile than that of undifferentiated cells in the presence of agents that dissipated mitochondrial proton gradients. Differentiated PC12 cells have a small component of Ca$^{2+}$ clearance possessing pharmacological characteristics consistent with secretory pathway Ca$^{2+}$ ATPase (SPCA), potentially residing on Golgi and/or secretory granules. Undifferentiated and differentiated cells are similar in overall Ca$^{2+}$ transport and in the small transport due to SERCA, but they differ in the fraction of transport by PMCA and NCX. Transport in neurites of differentiated PC12 cells was qualitatively similar to that in the somata, except that the ER stores in neurites sometimes released Ca$^{2+}$ instead of clearing it after depolarization. We formulated a mathematical model to simulate the observed Ca$^{2+}$ clearance and to describe the differences between these undifferentiated and NGF-differentiated states quantitatively. The model required a value for the endogenous Ca$^{2+}$ binding ratio of PC12 cell cytoplasm, which we measured to be 268 +/- 85. Our results indicate that Ca$^{2+}$ transport in undifferentiated PC12 cells is quite unlike transport in adrenal chromaffin cells, for which they often are considered models. Transport in both cell states more closely resembles that of sympathetic neurons, for which differentiated PC12 cells often are considered models. Comparison with other cell types shows that different cells emphasize different Ca$^{2+}$ transport mechanisms.},

abstract = {Vertebrate mitochondria contain a complex system for transport of Ca$^{2+}$ and related ions, consisting of two saturable modes of Ca$^{2+}$ influx and two separate, saturable mechanisms of Ca$^{2+}$ efflux. The characteristics of the mechanisms of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake, the uniporter and the RaM, are discussed here and suggestions are made about how the mechanisms may work together and separately to mediate the two physiological roles with which they are most commonly associated-control of the rate of cellular ATP production and induction of the permeability transition and apoptosis. It is argued that more subtlety of control of intramitochondrial free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) must be used by the uniporter and the RaM to fulfill their physiological roles than has been commonly recognized. This is because an increase in [Ca$^{2+}$]m is associated with both increased production of ATP which supports the continued life of the cell and with induction of the permeability transition and possibly apoptosis, which leads to cell death. The saturable mechanisms of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ efflux and the Ca$^{2+}$-induced mitochondrial permeability transition, which can transport Ca$^{2+}$ as well as other ions and molecules and is often considered as a Ca$^{2+}$ transport mechanism, are being reviewed separately.},

abstract = {Voltage-activated calcium channels can be divided into two subgroups based on their activation threshold, low-voltage-activated (LVA) and high-voltage-activated (HVA). Auxiliary subunits of the HVA calcium channels contribute significantly to biophysical properties of the channels. We have cloned and characterized members of two families of auxiliary subunits: alpha2delta and gamma. Two new alpha2delta subunits, alpha2delta-2 and alpha2delta-3, regulate all classes of HVA calcium channels. While the ubiquitous alpha2delta-2 modulates both neuronal and non-neuronal channels with similar efficiency, the alpha2delta-3 subunit regulates Ca(v)2.3 channels more effectively. Furthermore, alpha2delta-2 may modulate the LVA Ca(v)3.1 channel. Four new gamma subunits, gamma-2, gamma-3, gamma-4 and gamma-5, were characterized. The gamma-2 subunit modulated both the non-neuronal Ca(v)1.2 channel and the neuronal Ca(v)2.1 channel. The gamma-4 subunit affected only the Ca(v)2.1 channel. The gamma-5 subunit may be a regulatory subunit of the LVA Ca(v)3.1 channel. The Ca(v)1.2 channel is a major target for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. We have mapped the interaction site for clinically important channel blockers - dihydropyridines (DHPs) - and analysed the underlying inhibition mechanism. High-affinity inhibition is characterized by interaction with inactivated state of the channel. Its structural determinants are amino acids of the IVS6 segment, with smaller contribution of the IS6 segment, which contributes to voltage-dependence of DHP inhibition. Removal of amino acids responsible for the high-affinity inhibition revealed a low-affinity open channel block, in which amino acids of the IIIS5 and IIIS6 segments take part. Experiments with a permanently charged DHP suggested that there is another low-affinity interaction site on the alpha(1) subunit. We have cloned and characterized murine neuronal LVA Ca(v)3.1 channel. The channel has high sensitivity to the organic blocker mibefradil, moderate sensitivity to phenytoin, and low sensitivity to ethosuximide, amiloride and valproat. The channel is insensitive to tetrodotoxin and DHPs. The inorganic blockers Ni2+ and Cd2+ are moderately effective compared to La3+. The current through the Ca(v)3.1 channel inactivates faster with Ba2+ compared to Ca$^{2+}$. Molecular determinants of fast inactivation are located in amino side of the intracellular carboxy terminus. The voltage dependence of charge movement is very shallow compared to the voltage dependence of current activation. Transfer of 30 \% of charge correlates with activation of 70 \% of measurable macroscopic current. Prolonged depolarization does not immobilize charge movement of the Ca(v)3.1 channel.},

Though the Ca$^{2+}$ sensor for rapid exocytosis, synaptotagmin I, has been studied in depth, the sensor for asynchronous release remains unknown. In a screen for neuronal Ca$^{2+}$ sensors that respond to changes in [Ca$^{2+}$] with markedly slower kinetics than synaptotagmin I, we observed that Doc2--another Ca$^{2+}$, SNARE, and lipid-binding protein--operates on timescales consistent with asynchronous release. Moreover, up- and downregulation of Doc2 expression levels in hippocampal neurons increased or decreased, respectively, the slow phase of synaptic transmission. Synchronous release, when triggered by single action potentials, was unaffected by manipulation of Doc2 but was enhanced during repetitive stimulation in Doc2 knockdown neurons, potentially due to greater vesicle availability. In summary, we propose that Doc2 is a Ca$^{2+}$ sensor that is kinetically tuned to regulate asynchronous neurotransmitter release.},

abstract = {Fertilization calcium waves are introduced, and the evidence from which we can infer general mechanisms of these waves is presented. The two main classes of hypotheses put forward to explain the generation of the fertilization calcium wave are set out, and it is concluded that initiation of the fertilization calcium wave can be most generally explained in invertebrates by a mechanism in which an activating substance enters the egg from the sperm on sperm-egg fusion, activating the egg by stimulating phospholipase C activation through a src family kinase pathway and in mammals by the diffusion of a sperm-specific phospholipase C from sperm to egg on sperm-egg fusion. The fertilization calcium wave is then set into the context of cell cycle control, and the mechanism of repetitive calcium spiking in mammalian eggs is investigated. Evidence that calcium signals control cell division in early embryos is reviewed, and it is concluded that calcium signals are essential at all three stages of cell division in early embryos. Evidence that phosphoinositide signaling pathways control the resumption of meiosis during oocyte maturation is considered. It is concluded on balance that the evidence points to a need for phosphoinositide/calcium signaling during resumption of meiosis. Changes to the calcium signaling machinery occur during meiosis to enable the production of a calcium wave in the mature oocyte when it is fertilized; evidence that the shape and structure of the endoplasmic reticulum alters dynamically during maturation and after fertilization is reviewed, and the link between ER dynamics and the cytoskeleton is discussed. There is evidence that calcium signaling plays a key part in the development of patterning in early embryos. Morphogenesis in ascidian, frog, and zebrafish embryos is briefly described to provide the developmental context in which calcium signals act. Intracellular calcium waves that may play a role in axis formation in ascidian are discussed. Evidence that the Wingless/calcium signaling pathway is a strong ventralizing signal in Xenopus, mediated by phosphoinositide signaling, is adumbrated. The central role that calcium channels play in morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and in ectodermal and mesodermal gene expression during late gastrulation is demonstrated. Experiments in zebrafish provide a strong indication that calcium signals are essential for pattern formation and organogenesis.},

abstract = {Many cells display oscillations in intracellular calcium resulting from the periodic release of calcium from intracellular reservoirs. Frequencies are varied, but most oscillations have periods ranging from 5 to 60 s. For any given cell, frequency can vary depending on external conditions, particularly the concentration of natural stimuli or calcium. This cytosolic calcium oscillator is particularly sensitive to those stimuli (neurotransmitters, hormones, growth factors) that hydrolyze phosphoinositides to give diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins1,4,5P3). The ability of Ins1,4,5P3 to mobilize intracellular calcium is a significant feature of many of the proposed models that are used to explain oscillatory activity. Receptor-controlled oscillator models propose that there are complex feedback mechanisms that generate oscillations in the level of Ins1,4,5P3. Second messenger-controlled oscillator models demonstrate that the oscillator is a component of the calcium reservoir, which is induced to release calcium by a constant input of either Ins1,4,5P3 or calcium itself. In the latter case, the process of calcium-induced calcium release might be the basis of oscillatory activity in many cell types. The function of calcium oscillations is still unknown. Because oscillator frequency can vary with agonist concentration, calcium transients might be part of a frequency-encoded signaling system. When an external stimulus arrives at the cell surface the information is translated into a train of calcium spikes, i.e., the signal is digitized. Certain cells may then convey information by varying the frequency of this digital signal.},

abstract = {The calpain system originally comprised three molecules: two Ca$^{2+}$-dependent proteases, mu-calpain and m-calpain, and a third polypeptide, calpastatin, whose only known function is to inhibit the two calpains. Both mu- and m-calpain are heterodimers containing an identical 28-kDa subunit and an 80-kDa subunit that shares 55-65\% sequence homology between the two proteases. The crystallographic structure of m-calpain reveals six "domains" in the 80-kDa subunit: 1). a 19-amino acid NH2-terminal sequence; 2). and 3). two domains that constitute the active site, IIa and IIb; 4). domain III; 5). an 18-amino acid extended sequence linking domain III to domain IV; and 6). domain IV, which resembles the penta EF-hand family of polypeptides. The single calpastatin gene can produce eight or more calpastatin polypeptides ranging from 17 to 85 kDa by use of different promoters and alternative splicing events. The physiological significance of these different calpastatins is unclear, although all bind to three different places on the calpain molecule; binding to at least two of the sites is Ca$^{2+}$ dependent. Since 1989, cDNA cloning has identified 12 additional mRNAs in mammals that encode polypeptides homologous to domains IIa and IIb of the 80-kDa subunit of mu- and m-calpain, and calpain-like mRNAs have been identified in other organisms. The molecules encoded by these mRNAs have not been isolated, so little is known about their properties. How calpain activity is regulated in cells is still unclear, but the calpains ostensibly participate in a variety of cellular processes including remodeling of cytoskeletal/membrane attachments, different signal transduction pathways, and apoptosis. Deregulated calpain activity following loss of Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis results in tissue damage in response to events such as myocardial infarcts, stroke, and brain trauma.},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ plays a central role in energy supply and demand matching in cardiomyocytes by transmitting changes in excitation-contraction coupling to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Matrix Ca$^{2+}$ is controlled primarily by the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter and the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger, influencing NADH production through Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive dehydrogenases in the Krebs cycle. In addition to the well-accepted role of the Ca$^{2+}$-triggered mitochondrial permeability transition pore in cell death, it has been proposed that the permeability transition pore might also contribute to physiological mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ release. Here we selectively measure Ca$^{2+}$ influx rate through the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter and Ca$^{2+}$ efflux rates through Na(+)-dependent and Na(+)-independent pathways in isolated guinea pig heart mitochondria in the presence or absence of inhibitors of mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger (CGP 37157) or the permeability transition pore (cyclosporine A). cyclosporine A suppressed the negative bioenergetic consequences ($\Delta$$\Psi$(m) loss, Ca$^{2+}$ release, NADH oxidation, swelling) of high extramitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ additions, allowing mitochondria to tolerate total mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ loads of >400nmol/mg protein. For Ca$^{2+}$ pulses up to 15$\mu$M, Na(+)-independent Ca$^{2+}$ efflux through the permeability transition pore accounted for \~{}5\% of the total Ca$^{2+}$ efflux rate compared to that mediated by the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger (in 5mM Na(+)). Unexpectedly, we also observed that cyclosporine A inhibited mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ efflux at higher concentrations (IC(50)=2$\mu$M) than those required to inhibit the permeability transition pore, with a maximal inhibition of \~{}40\% at 10$\mu$M cyclosporine A, while having no effect on the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter. The results suggest a possible alternative mechanism by which cyclosporine A could affect mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ load in cardiomyocytes, potentially explaining the paradoxical toxic effects of cyclosporine A at high concentrations.

abstract = {Effects of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs): N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide), N-oleoylethanolamine and N-palmitoylethanolamine, on energy coupling and permeability of rat heart mitochondria were investigated. In nominally Ca$^{2+}$-free media, these compounds exerted a weak protonophoric effect manifested by dissipation of the transmembrane potential and stimulation of resting state respiration. The strongest action was exhibited by N-arachidonoylethanolamine, followed by N-oleoylethanolamine, whereas N-palmitoylethanolamine was almost inactive. These protonophoric effects were resistant to cyclosporin A (CsA) and were much weaker than those of corresponding nonesterified fatty acids. In uncoupled mitochondria N-arachidonoylethanolamine and N-oleoylethanolamine partly inhibited mitochondrial respiration with glutamate and succinate but not with tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) plus ascorbate as respiratory substrates. In mitochondria preloaded with small amounts of Ca$^{2+}$, NAEs produced a much stronger dissipation of the membrane potential and a release of accumulated calcium, both effects being inhibited by CsA, indicative for opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). Again, the potency of this action was N-arachidonoylethanolamine>N-oleoylethanolamine>N-palmitoylethanolamine. However, in spite of making the matrix space accessible to external [14C]sucrose, N-arachidonoylethanolamine and N-oleoylethanolamine resulted in only a limited swelling of mitochondria and diminished the rate of swelling produced by high Ca$^{2+}$ load.},

abstract = {Stimulation of receptors on the surface of animal cells often evokes cellular responses by raising intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration. The rise in cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ drives a plethora of processes, including neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and cell growth and proliferation. Mitochondria help shape intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals through their ability to rapidly take up significant amounts of Ca$^{2+}$ from the cytosol via the uniporter, a Ca$^{2+}$-selective ion channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The uniporter is subject to inactivation, whereby a sustained cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ rise prevents further Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. In spite of its importance in intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling, little is known about the mechanism underlying uniporter inactivation. Here, we report that maneuvers that promote matrix alkalinisation significantly reduce inactivation whereas acidification exacerbates it. We further show that the F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase complex is an important source of protons for inactivation of the uniporter. These findings identify a novel molecular mechanism that regulates the activity of this ubiquitous intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ channel, with implications for intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling and aerobic ATP production.},

Interactions between the cytoplasmic and membrane compartments are considered and the effects of these interactions on oscillatory behaviour is discussed. Because of their biological importance and the greater body of experimental results, particular attention is directed to a study of membrane potential oscillations. These systems can be approximately classified in two groups: (i) systems in which a periodic potential results from oscillatory changes in permeability and (ii) systems in which potential oscillations result from the periodic activity of an electrogenic pump. The examples considered include the glycolytic oscillator, oscillations in vein contraction in the slime mould Physarum polycephalum, rhythmic aggregation in Dictyostelium discoideum, neural oscillators, the periodic potential in Purkinje fibres and the sino-atrial node and rhythmic behaviour in smooth muscle. Questions considered include the generation of periodic activity, the modulation of the oscillation by drugs and other metabolic and membrane effectors and the question of the functional role of these oscillations.},

Recent studies revealed zones of close contact between the ER and mitochondria called MAMs (Mitochondria Associated Membranes) crucial for a correct communication between the two organelles, including the selective transmission of physiological and pathological Ca$^{2+}$ signals from the ER to mitochondria. In this review, we summarize the most up-to-date findings on the modulation of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ release and Ca$^{2+}$ uptake mechanisms.

abstract = {The dynamics of mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$](M)) plays a key role in a variety of cellular processes. The most important methods available to monitor [Ca$^{2+}$](M) are fluorescent dyes such as rhod-2 and specifically targeted proteins such as aequorin and pericam. However, significant discrepancies, both quantitative and qualitative, exist in the literature between the results obtained with different methods. We have made here a systematic comparison of the response of several fluorescent dyes, rhod-2 and rhod-FF, and two Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive proteins, aequorin and pericam. Our results show that measurements obtained with aequorin and pericam are consistent in terms of dynamic Ca$^{2+}$ changes. Instead, fluorescent dyes failed to follow Ca$^{2+}$ changes adequately, especially during repetitive stimulation. In particular, measures obtained with rhod-2 or rhod-FF evidenced the previously reported Ca$^{2+}$-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake, but data obtained with aequorin or pericam under the same conditions did not. The reason for the loss of response of fluorescent dyes is unclear. Loading with these dyes produced changes in mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential, which were small and reversible at low concentrations (1-2 microM), but produced large and prolonged damage at higher concentrations. In addition, cells loaded with low concentrations of rhod-2 suffered large changes in mitochondrial morphology after light excitation. Our results suggest that [Ca$^{2+}$](M) data obtained with these dyes should be taken with care.},

We show by electron tomography that ER and mitochondria are adjoined by tethers that are approximately 10 nm at the smooth ER and approximately 25 nm at the rough ER. Limited proteolysis separates ER from mitochondria, whereas expression of a short "synthetic linker" (<5 nm) leads to tightening of the associations. Although normal connections are necessary and sufficient for proper propagation of ER-derived calcium signals to the mitochondria, tightened connections, synthetic or naturally observed under apoptosis-inducing conditions, make mitochondria prone to Ca$^{2+}$ overloading and ensuing permeability transition.

abstract = {Calcium depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces oligomerisation, puncta formation and translocation of the ER Ca$^{2+}$ sensor proteins, STIM1 and -2 into plasma membrane (PM)-adjacent regions of the ER, where they activate the Orai1, -2 or -3 proteins present in the opposing PM. These proteins form ion channels through which store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ influx (SOC) occurs. Calcium ions exert negative feed-back on SOC. Here we examined whether subplasmalemmal mitochondria, which reduce this feed-back by Ca$^{2+}$ uptake, are located within or out of the high-Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains (HCMDs) formed between the ER and plasmalemmal Orai1 channels. For this purpose, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with Orai1, STIM1 labelled with YFP or mRFP and the mitochondrially targeted Ca$^{2+}$ sensitive fluorescent protein inverse-Pericam. Depletion of ER Ca$^{2+}$ with ATP+thapsigargin (in Ca$^{2+}$-free medium) induced the appearance of STIM1 puncta in the < or =100 nm wide subplasmalemmal space, as examined with TIRF. Mitochondria were located either in the gaps between STIM1-tagged puncta or in remote, STIM1-free regions. After addition of Ca$^{2+}$ mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentration increased irrespective of the mitochondrion-STIM1 distance. These observations indicate that mitochondria are exposed to Ca$^{2+}$ diffused laterally from the HCMDs formed between the PM and the subplasmalemmal ER.},

abstract = {The omega-conotoxins are a set of structurally related, four-loop, six cysteine containing peptides, that have a range of selectivities for different subtypes of the voltage-sensitive calcium channel (VSCC). To investigate the basis of the selectivity displayed by these peptides, we have studied the binding affinities of two naturally occurring omega-conotoxins, MVIIA and MVIIC and a series of 14 MVIIA/MVIIC loop hybrids using radioligand binding assays for N and P/Q-type Ca$^{2+}$channels in rat brain tissue. A selectivity profile was developed from the ratio of relative potencies at N-type VSCCs (using [125I]GVIA radioligand binding assays) and P/Q-type VSCCs (using [125I]MVIIC radioligand binding assays). In these peptides, loops 2 and 4 make the greatest contribution to VSCC subtype selectivity, while the effects of loops 1 and 3 are negligible. Peptides with homogenous combinations of loop 2 and 4 display clear selectivity preferences, while those with heterogeneous combinations of loops 2 and 4 are less discriminatory. 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that the global folds of MVIIA, MVIIC and the 14 loop hybrid peptides were similar; however, several differences in local structure were identified. Based on the binding data and the 3D structures of MVIIA, GVIA and MVIIC, we have developed a preliminary pharmacophore based on the omega-conotoxin residues most likely to interact with the N-type VSCC.},

The cDNA, 16,532 base pairs in length, encodes a protein of 4,969 amino acids with a Mr of 564,711. The deduced amino acid sequence is 66\% identical with that of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, but analysis of predicted secondary structures and hydropathy plots suggests that the two isoforms exhibit the same topology in both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. A potential ATP binding domain was identified at residues 2619-2652, a potential phosphorylation site at residue 2809, and potential calmodulin binding sites at residues 2775-2807, 2877-2898, and 2998-3016. We suggest that a modulator binding domain in the protein lies between residues 2619 and 3016. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from a variety of tissues demonstrated that the cardiac isoform is expressed in heart and brain, while the skeletal muscle isoform is expressed in both fast- and slow-twitch muscle. No ryanodine receptor mRNA was detected in extracts from smooth muscle or any other non-muscle tissue examined. The two receptors are clearly the products of separate genes, and the gene encoding the cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor was localized to chromosome 1.},

Because nsSNPs can affect protein function, they are believed to have the largest impact on human health compared with SNPs in other regions of the genome. Therefore, it is important to distinguish those nsSNPs that affect protein function from those that are functionally neutral. Here we provide an overview of amino acid substitution (AAS) prediction methods, which use sequence and/or structure to predict the effect of an AAS on protein function. Most methods predict approximately 25-30\% of human nsSNPs to negatively affect protein function, and such nsSNPs tend to be rare in the population. We discuss the utility of AAS prediction methods for Mendelian and complex diseases as well as their broader applications for understanding protein function.},

@article{Parekh2003,
abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, hormones and neurotransmitters that engage the phosphoinositide pathway evoke a biphasic increase in intracellular free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration: an initial transient release of Ca$^{2+}$ from intracellular stores is followed by a sustained phase of Ca$^{2+}$ influx. This influx is generally store-dependent and is required for controlling a host of Ca$^{2+}$-dependent processes ranging from exocytosis to cell growth and proliferation. In many cell types, store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry is manifest as a non-voltage-gated Ca$^{2+}$ current called ICRAC (Ca$^{2+}$ release-activated Ca$^{2+}$ current). Just how store emptying activates CRAC channels remains unclear, and some of our recent experiments that address this issue will be described. No less important from a physiological perspective is the weak Ca$^{2+}$ buffer paradox: whereas macroscopic (whole cell) ICRAC can be measured routinely in the presence of strong intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ buffer, the current is generally not detectable under physiological conditions of weak buffering following store emptying with the second messenger InsP3. In this review, I describe some of our experiments aimed at understanding just why InsP3 is ineffective under these conditions and which lead us to conclude that respiring mitochondria are essential for the activation of ICRAC in weak intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ buffer. Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake also increases the dynamic range over which InsP3 functions as the second messenger that controls Ca$^{2+}$ influx. Finally, we find that Ca$^{2+}$-dependent slow inactivation of Ca$^{2+}$ influx, a widespread but poorly understood phenomenon that helps shape the profile of an intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signal, is regulated by mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ buffering. Thus, by enabling macroscopic store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ current to activate and then by controlling its extent and duration, mitochondria play a crucial role in all stages of store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ influx. Store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry reflects therefore a dynamic interplay between endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) has been suggested to be a mediator of mitochondrial-dependent cell death induced by Ca$^{2+}$ overload, oxidative stress and Bax-Bid activation. To confirm this hypothesis in vivo, we generated and characterized Drosophila VDAC (porin) mutants and found that Porin is not required for mitochondrial apoptosis, which is consistent with the previous mouse studies. We also reported a novel physiological role of Porin. Loss of porin resulted in locomotive defects and male sterility. Intriguingly, porin mutants exhibited elongated mitochondria in indirect flight muscle, whereas Porin overexpression produced fragmented mitochondria. Through genetic analysis with the components of mitochondrial fission and fusion, we found that the elongated mitochondria phenotype in porin mutants were suppressed by increased mitochondrial fission, but enhanced by increased mitochondrial fusion. Furthermore, increased mitochondrial fission by Drp1 expression suppressed the flight defects in the porin mutants. Collectively, our study showed that loss of Drosophila Porin results in mitochondrial morphological defects and suggested that the defective mitochondrial function by Porin deficiency affects the mitochondrial remodeling process.},

abstract = {P2X receptors are ATP-gated cation channels with important roles in diverse pathophysiological processes. Substantial progress has been made in the last few years with the discovery of both subunit selective antagonists and modulators. The purpose of this brief review is to summarize the advances in the pharmacology of P2X receptors, with key properties presented in an easy to access format. Ligand-gated ion channels consist of three families in mammals; the ionotropic glutamate receptors, the Cys-loop receptors (for GABA, ACh, glycine and serotonin) and the P2X receptors for ATP. The first two of these are considered in articles accompanying this Special Issue. Here we consider the pharmacological properties of P2X receptors. We do not present a detailed discussion of P2X receptor physiological roles or structure-function studies. Moreover, the pharmacological basis for discriminating between the main subtypes of P2X receptor and their nomenclature has been published by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Pharmacology (NC-IUPHAR) P2X Receptor Subcommittee, and so these aspects are not revisited here. Instead in this brief article we seek to present a summary of the pharmacology of recombinant homomeric and heteromeric P2X receptors, with particular emphasis on new antagonists. In this article we have tried to present as much information as possible in two tables in the hope this will be useful as a day-to-day resource, and also because an excellent and detailed review has recently been published.},

@article{Carafoli2010,
abstract = {A number of findings in the 1950s had offered indirect indications that mitochondria could accumulate Ca$^{2+}$. In 1961, the phenomenon was directly demonstrated using isolated mitochondria: the uptake process was driven by respiratory chain activity or by the hydrolysis of added ATP. It could be accompanied by the simultaneous uptake of inorganic phosphate, in which case precipitates of hydroxyapatite were formed in the matrix, buffering its free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration. The properties of the uptake process were established in the 1960s and 1970s: the uptake of Ca$^{2+}$ occurred electrophoretically on a carrier that has not yet been molecularly identified, and was released from mitochondria via a Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ antiporter. A H+/Ca$^{2+}$ release exchanger was also found to operate in some mitochondrial types. The permeability transition pore was later also found to mediate the efflux of Ca$^{2+}$ from mitochondria. In the mitochondrial matrix two TCA cycle dehydrogenases and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase were found to be regulated in the matrix by the cycling of Ca$^{2+}$ across the inner membrane. In conditions of cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ overload mitochondria could store for a time large amounts of precipitated Ca$^{2+}$-phosphate, thus permitting cells to survive situations of Ca$^{2+}$ emergency. The uptake process was found to have very low affinity for Ca$^{2+}$: since the bulk concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ in the cytoplasm is in the low to mid-nM range, it became increasingly difficult to postulate a role of mitochondria in the regulation of cytoplsmic Ca$^{2+}$. A number of findings had nevertheless shown that energy linked Ca$^{2+}$ transport occurred efficiently in mitochondria of various tissues in situ. The paradox was only solved in the 1990s, when it was found that the concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ in the cytoplasm is not uniform: perimitochondrial micropools are created by the agonist-promoted discharge of Ca$^{2+}$ from vicinal stores in which the concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ is high enough to activate the low affinity mitochondrial uniporter. Mitochondria thus regained center stage as important regulators of cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ (not only of their own internal Ca$^{2+}$). Their Ca$^{2+}$ uptake systems was found to react very rapidly to cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ demands, even in the 150-200 msec time scale of processes like the contraction and relaxation of heart. An important recent development in the area of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport is its involvement in the disease process. Ca$^{2+}$ signaling defects are now gaining increasing importance in the pathogenesis of diseases, e.g., neurodegenerative diseases. Since mitochondria have now regained a central role in the regulation of cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$, dysfunctions of their Ca$^{2+}$ controlling systems have expectedly been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of numerous disease processes.},

abstract = {Mitochondria from every tissue are quite similar in their capability to accumulate Ca²⁺ in a process that depends on the electrical potential across the inner membrane; it is catalyzed by a gated channel (named mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uniporter), the molecular identity of which has only recently been unraveled. The release of accumulated Ca²⁺ in mitochondria from different tissues is, on the contrary, quite variable, both in terms of speed and mechanism: a Na⁺-dependent efflux in excitable cells (catalyzed by NCLX) and a H⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger in other cells. The efficacy of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in living cells is strictly dependent on the topological arrangement of the organelles with respect to the source of Ca²⁺ flowing into the cytoplasm, i.e., plasma membrane or intracellular channels. In turn, the structural and functional relationships between mitochondria and other cellular membranes are dictated by the specific architecture of different cells. Mitochondria not only modulate the amplitude and the kinetics of local and bulk cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ changes but also depend on the Ca²⁺ signal for their own functionality, in particular for their capacity to produce ATP. In this review, we summarize the processes involved in mitochondrial Ca²⁺ handling and its integration in cell physiology, highlighting the main common characteristics as well as key differences, in different tissues.},

abstract = {Calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) is a universal signalling molecule involved in many aspects of cellular function. The majority of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ is stored in the endoplasmic reticulum and once Ca$^{2+}$ is released from the endoplasmic reticulum, specific plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$ channels are activated, resulting in increased intracellular Ca$^{2+}$. In the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, Ca$^{2+}$ is buffered by Ca$^{2+}$ binding chaperones such as calreticulin. Calreticulin-deficiency is lethal in utero due to impaired cardiac development and in the absence of calreticulin, Ca$^{2+}$ storage capacity within the endoplasmic reticulum and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release from the endoplasmic reticulum are compromised. Over-expression of constitutively active calcineurin in the heart rescues calreticulin-deficient mice from embryonic lethality. This observation indicates that calreticulin is a key upstream regulator of calcineurin in Ca$^{2+}$-signalling pathways and highlights the importance of the endoplasmic reticulum and endoplasmic reticulum-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis for cellular commitment and tissue development during organogenesis. Furthermore, Ca$^{2+}$ handling by the endoplasmic reticulum has profound effects on cell sensitivity to apoptosis. Signalling between calreticulin in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and calcineurin in the cytoplasm may play a role in the modulation of cell sensitivity to apoptosis and the regulation of Ca$^{2+}$-dependent apoptotic pathways.},

abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria are tubular organelles with a characteristic "network structure" that facilitates the formation of interorganellar connections. The ER and mitochondria join together at multiple contact sites to form specific domains, termed mitochondria-ER associated membranes (MAMs), with distinct biochemical properties and a characteristic set of proteins. The functions of these two organelles are coordinated and executed at the ER-mitochondria interface, which provides a platform for the regulation of different processes. The roles played by the ER-mitochondria interface range from the coordination of calcium transfer to the regulation of mitochondrial fission and inflammasome formation as well as the provision of membranes for autophagy. The novel and unconventional processes that occur at the ER-mitochondria interface demonstrate its multifunctional and intrinsically dynamic nature. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Dynamic and ultrastructure of bioenergetic membranes and their components.},

abstract = {The calcium binding proteins of the EF-hand super-family are involved in the regulation of all aspects of cell function. These proteins exhibit a great diversity of composition, structure, Ca$^{2+}$-binding and target interaction properties. Here, our current understanding of the Ca$^{2+}$-binding mechanism is assessed. The structures of the EF-hand motifs containing 11-14 amino acid residues in the Ca$^{2+}$-binding loop are analyzed within the framework of the recently proposed two-step Ca$^{2+}$-binding mechanism. A hypothesis is put forward that in all EF-hand proteins the Ca$^{2+}$-binding and the resultant conformational responses are governed by the central structure connecting the Ca$^{2+}$-binding loops in the two-EF-hand domain. This structure, named EFbeta-scaffold, defines the position of the bound Ca$^{2+}$, and coordinates the function of the N-terminal (variable and flexible) with the C-terminal (invariable and rigid) parts of the Ca$^{2+}$-binding loop. It is proposed that the nature of the first ligand of the Ca$^{2+}$-binding loop is an important determinant of the conformational change. Additional factors, including the interhelical contacts, the length, structure and flexibility of the linker connecting the EF-hand motifs, and the overall energy balance provide the fine-tuning of the Ca$^{2+}$-induced conformational change in the EF-hand proteins.},

@article{Marhl1997,
abstract = {A refined electrochemical model accounting for intracellular calcium oscillations and their interrelations with oscillations of the potential difference across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or other intracellular calcium stores is established. The ATP dependent uptake of Ca$^{2+}$ from the cytosol into the ER, the Ca$^{2+}$ release from the ER through channels following a calcium-induced calcium release mechanism, and a potential-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ leak flux out of the ER are included in the model and described by plausible rate laws. The binding of calcium to specific proteins such as calmodulin is taken into account. The quasi-electroneutrality condition allows us to express the transmembrane potential in terms of the concentrations of cytosolic calcium and free binding sites on proteins, which are the two independent variables of the model. We include monovalent ions in the model, because they make up a considerable portion in the balance of electroneutrality. As the permeability of the endoplasmic membrane for these ions is much higher than that for calcium ions, we assume the former to be in Nernst equilibrium. A stability analysis of the steady-state solutions (which are unique or multiple depending on parameter values) is carried out and the Hopf bifurcation leading from stable steady states to self-sustained oscillations is analysed with the help of appropriate mathematical techniques. The oscillations obtained by numerical integration exhibit the typical spike-like shape found in experiments and reasonable values of frequency and amplitude. The model describes the process of switching between stationary and pulsatile regimes as well as changes in oscillation frequency upon parameter changes. It turns out that calcium oscillations can arise without a permanent influx of calcium into the cell, when a calcium-buffering system such as calmodulin is included.},

abstract = {Allelic deletions on human chromosome 12q24 are frequently reported in a variety of malignant neoplasms, indicating the presence of a tumor suppressor gene(s) in this chromosomal region. However, no reasonable candidate has been identified so far. In this study, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a novel mitochondrial protein with tumor suppressor activity, henceforth designated MITOSTATIN. Human MITOSTATIN was found within a 3.2-kb transcript, which encoded a approximately 62 kDa, ubiquitously expressed protein with little homology to any known protein. We found homozygous deletions and mutations of MITOSTATIN gene in approximately 5 and approximately 11\% of various cancer-derived cells and solid tumors, respectively. When transiently overexpressed, MITOSTATIN inhibited colony formation, tumor cell growth and was proapoptotic, all features shared by established tumor suppressor genes. We discovered a specific link between MITOSTATIN overexpression and downregulation of Hsp27. Conversely, MITOSTATIN knockdown cells showed an increase in cell growth and cell survival rates. Finally, MITOSTATIN expression was significantly reduced in primary bladder and breast tumors, and its reduction was associated with advanced tumor stages. Our findings support the hypothesis that MITOSTATIN has many hallmarks of a classical tumor suppressor in solid tumors and may play an important role in cancer development and progression.},

abstract = {Rod outer segment membrane guanylate cyclase (ROS-GC1) is a bimodal Ca$^{2+}$ signal transduction switch. Lowering [Ca$^{2+}$](i) from 200 to 20 nM progressively turns it "ON" as does raising [Ca$^{2+}$](i) from 500 to 5000 nM. The mode operating at lower [Ca$^{2+}$](i) plays a vital role in phototransduction in both rods and cones. The physiological function of the mode operating at elevated [Ca$^{2+}$](i) is not known. Through comprehensive studies on mice involving gene deletions, biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, electroretinograms and single cell recordings, the present study demonstrates that the Ca$^{2+}$-sensor S100B coexists with and is physiologically linked to ROS-GC1 in cones but not in rods. It up-regulates ROS-GC1 activity with a K(1/2) for Ca$^{2+}$ greater than 500 nM and modulates the transmission of neural signals to cone ON-bipolar cells. Furthermore, a possibility is raised that under pathological conditions where [Ca$^{2+}$](i) levels rise to and perhaps even enter the micromolar range, the S100B signaling switch will be turned "ON" causing an explosive production of CNG channel opening and further rise in [Ca$^{2+}$](i) in cone outer segments. The findings define a new cone-specific Ca$^{2+}$-dependent feature of photoreceptors and expand our understanding of the operational principles of phototransduction machinery.},

abstract = {The mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) is a well-recognized phenomenon that allows mitochondria to undergo a sudden increase of permeability to solutes with molecular mass ≤ 1500Da, leading to organelle swelling and structural modifications. The relevance of PT relies on its master role in the manifestation of programmed cell death (PCD). This function is performed by a mega-channel (in some cases inhibited by cyclosporin A) named permeability transition pore (PTP), whose function could derive from the assembly of different mitochondrial proteins. In this paper we examine the distribution and characteristics of PTP in mitochondria of eukaryotic organisms so far investigated in order to draw a hypothesis on the mechanism of its evolution. As a result, we suggest that PTP may have arisen as a new function linked to a multiple molecular exaptation of different mitochondrial proteins, even though they could nevertheless still play their original role. Furthermore, we suggest that the early appearance of PTP could have had a crucial role in the establishment of endosymbiosis in eukaryotic cells, by the coordinated balancing of ATP production by glycolysis (performed by the primary phagocyte) and oxidative phosphorylation (accomplished by the endosymbiont). Indeed, we argue on the possibility that this new energetic equilibrium could have opened the way to the subsequent evolution toward metazoans.},

abstract = {Many cells use oscillations in calcium concentration to transmit messages. The oscillations largely result from an influx of calcium into the cytosol from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by an efflux of calcium from the cytosol back into the ER. The sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump pumps calcium into the ER. It binds calcium on the cytosolic side and releases it on the ER side and in the delay between binding and release, calcium is buffered by the pump. We developed a model of a buffering SERCA pump and investigated whether including this in a model of calcium oscillations has any significant effects. We found that the oscillations produced when using the SERCA pump, which does not buffer calcium, have a larger amplitude and a slightly smaller period than when using the buffering SERCA pump. We show that the buffering SERCA pump shows adaptation to a stimulus, and we demonstrate that, by using a bidirectional SERCA pump, we are able to eliminate futile cycling of calcium between the cytosol and ER when the cell is at rest.},

Here we simulate the full and reduced equations, exploring the conditions necessary for the validity of the rapid buffering approximation for an isolated Ca$^{2+}$ channel or a cluster of channels. Using a point source and performing numerical simulations of different durations, we quantify the error of the rapid buffering approximation as a function of buffer and source parameters as well as the time and spatial scale set by the resolution of confocal microscopic measurements. We carry out simulations of Ca$^{2+}$ "sparks" and "puffs," both with and without the indicator dye Ca$^{2+}$ Green-1, and find that the rapid buffering approximation is excellent. These calculations also show that the traditional calculation of [Ca$^{2+}$] from a fluorescence signal may grossly underestimate the true value of [Ca$^{2+}$] near a source. Finally, we use the full model to simulate the transient Ca$^{2+}$ domain near the pore of an open Ca$^{2+}$ channel in a cell dialyzed with millimolar concentrations of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid or EGTA.

Transfection of P2X7R increases resting mitochondrial potential (delta psi(mt)), basal mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ ([Ca$^{2+}$]mt), intracellular ATP content, and confers ability to grow in the absence of serum. These changes require a full pore-forming function, because they are abolished in cells transfected with a mutated P2X7R that retains channel activity but cannot form the nonselective pore, and depend on an autocrine/paracrine tonic stimulation by secreted ATP. On the other hand, sustained stimulation of P2X7R causes a delta psi(mt) drop, a large increase in [Ca$^{2+}$]mt, mitochondrial fragmentation, and cell death. These findings reveal a hitherto undescribed mechanism for growth stimulation by a plasma membrane pore.},

abstract = {A central concept in the field of learning and memory is that NMDARs are essential for synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Surprisingly then, multiple studies have found that behavioral experience can reduce or eliminate the contribution of these receptors to learning. The cellular mechanisms that mediate learning in the absence of NMDAR activation are currently unknown. To address this issue, we examined the contribution of Ca$^{2+}$-permeable AMPARs to learning and plasticity in the hippocampus. Mutant mice were engineered with a conditional genetic deletion of GluR2 in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (GluR2-cKO mice). Electrophysiology experiments in these animals revealed a novel form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that was independent of NMDARs and mediated by GluR2-lacking Ca$^{2+}$-permeable AMPARs. Behavioral analyses found that GluR2-cKO mice were impaired on multiple hippocampus-dependent learning tasks that required NMDAR activation. This suggests that AMPAR-mediated LTP interferes with NMDAR-dependent plasticity. In contrast, NMDAR-independent learning was normal in knockout mice and required the activation of Ca$^{2+}$-permeable AMPARs. These results suggest that GluR2-lacking AMPARs play a functional and previously unidentified role in learning; they appear to mediate changes in synaptic strength that occur after plasticity has been established by NMDARs.},

abstract = {Heart mitochondria contain a nNa$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ antiport that participates in the regulation of matrix [Ca$^{2+}$]. Based largely on a single study (Brand, M. D. (1985) Biochem. J. 229, 161-166), there has been a consensus that this antiport promotes the electroneutral exchange of two Na$^+$ for one Ca$^{2+}$. However, a recent study in our laboratory (Baysal, K., Jung, D. W., Gunter, K. K., Gunter, T. P., and Brierley, G. P. (1994) Am. J. Physiol. 266, C800-C808) has shown that the Na(+)-dependent efflux of Ca$^{2+}$ from heart mitochondria has more energy available to it than can be supplied by a passive 2Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange. We have therefore re-examined Brand's protocols using fluorescent probes to monitor matrix pH and free [Ca$^{2+}$]. Respiring heart mitochondria, suspended in KCl and treated with ruthenium red to block Ca$^{2+}$ influx, extrude Ca$^{2+}$ and establish a large [Ca$^{2+}$]out:[Ca$^{2+}$]matrix gradient. The extrusion of Ca$^{2+}$ under these conditions is Na(+)-dependent and diltiazem-sensitive and can be attributed to the nNa$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ antiport. Addition of nigericin increases the membrane potential (delta psi) and decreases delta pH to 0.1 or less, but has virtually no effect on the magnitude of the [Ca$^{2+}$] gradient. Under these conditions a gradient maintained by electroneutral 2Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ antiport should be abolished because the mitochondrial Na$^+$/H+ antiport keeps the [Na$^+$] gradient equivalent to the [H+] gradient. The [Ca$^{2+}$] gradient is abolished, however, when an uncoupler is added to dissipate delta psi or when the exogenous electroneutral antiport BrA23187 is added. In addition, [Ca$^{2+}$] influx via the nNa$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ antiport in nonrespiring mitochondria is enhanced when delta psi is abolished. These results are consistent with Ca$^{2+}$ extrusion by an electrophoretic antiport that can respond to delta psi but not with an electroneutral antiport.},

abstract = {The 3D structure of the PMCA pump has not been solved, but its basic mechanistic properties are known to repeat those of the other Ca$^{2+}$ pumps. However, the pump also has unique properties. They concern essentially its numerous regulatory mechanisms, the most important of which is the autoinhibition by its C-terminal tail. Other regulatory mechanisms involve protein kinases and the PL of the membrane in which the pump is embedded. Permanent activation of the pump, e.g., by calmodulin, is physiologically as harmful to cells as its absence. The concept is now emerging that the global control of cell Ca$^{2+}$ may not be the main function of the pump: in some cell types it could even be irrelevant. The main pump role would be the regulation of Ca$^{2+}$ in cell microdomains in which the pump co-segregates with partners that modulate the Ca$^{2+}$ message and transduce it to important cell functions.},

abstract = {Photoreactive azido ruthenium (AzRu) has been recently shown to specifically interact with Ca$^{2+}$-binding proteins and to strongly inhibit their Ca$^{2+}$-dependent activities. Upon UV irradiation, AzRu can bind covalently to such proteins. In this study, AzRu was used to localize and characterize Ca$^{2+}$-binding sites in the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). AzRu decreased the conductance of VDAC reconstituted into a bilayer while Ca$^{2+}$, in the presence of 1M NaCl, but not Mg(2+), prevented this effect. AzRu had no effect on mutated E72Q- or E202Q-VDAC1 conductance, and [(103)Ru]AzRu labeled native but not E72Q-VDAC1, suggesting that these residues are required for AzRu interaction with the VDAC Ca$^{2+}$-binding site(s). AzRu protected against apoptosis induced by over-expression of native but not E72Q- or E202Q- murine VDAC1 in T-REx-293 cells depleted of endogenous hVDAC1. Chymotrypsin and trypsin digestion of AzRu-labeled VDAC followed by MALDI-TOF analysis revealed two AzRu-bound peptides corresponding to E72- and E202-containing sequences. These results suggest that the VDAC Ca$^{2+}$-binding site includes E72 and E202, located, according to a proposed VDAC1 topology model, on two distinct cytosolic loops. Furthermore, AzRu protection against apoptosis involves interaction with these residues. Photoreactive AzRu represents an important tool for identifying novel Ca$^{2+}$-binding proteins and localizing their Ca$^{2+}$-binding sites.},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ is a key regulator not only of multiple cytosolic enzymes, but also of a variety of metabolic pathways occurring within the lumen of intracellular organelles. Until recently, no technique to selectively monitor the Ca$^{2+}$ concentration within defined cellular compartments was available. We have recently proposed the use of molecularly engineered Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive photoproteins to obtain such a result and demonstrated the application of this methodology to the study of mitochondrial and nuclear Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics. We here describe in more detail the use of chimeric recombinant aequorin targeted to the mitochondria. The technique can be applied with equivalent results to different cell models, transiently or permanently transfected. In all the cell types we analyzed, mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) increases rapidly and transiently upon stimulation with agonists coupled to InsP3 generation. We confirm that the high speed of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation with this type of stimuli depends on the generation of local gradients of Ca$^{2+}$ in the cytosol, close to the channels sensitive to InsP3. In fact, only activation of these channels, but not the simple release from internal stores, as that elicited by blocking the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ ATPases, results in a fast mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation. We also provide evidence in favor of a microheterogeneity among mitochondria of the same cells, about 30\% of them apparently sensing the microdomains of high cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]c). The changes in [Ca$^{2+}$]m appear sufficiently large to induce a rapid activation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, which can be followed by monitoring the level of NAD(P)H fluorescence. A general scheme can thus be envisaged by which the triggering of a plasma membrane receptor coupled to InsP3 generation raises the Ca$^{2+}$ concentration both in the cytoplasm (thereby triggering energy-consuming processes, such as cell proliferation, motility, secretion, etc.) and in the mitochondria, where it activates the metabolic activity according to the increased cell needs.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake via the uniporter is central to cell metabolism, signaling, and survival. Recent studies identified MCU as the uniporter's likely pore and MICU1, an EF-hand protein, as its critical regulator. How this complex decodes dynamic cytoplasmic [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$]c) signals, to tune out small [Ca$^{2+}$]c increases yet permit pulse transmission, remains unknown. We report that loss of MICU1 in mouse liver and cultured cells causes mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation during small [Ca$^{2+}$]c elevations but an attenuated response to agonist-induced [Ca$^{2+}$]c pulses. The latter reflects loss of positive cooperativity, likely via the EF-hands. MICU1 faces the intermembrane space and responds to [Ca$^{2+}$]c changes. Prolonged MICU1 loss leads to an adaptive increase in matrix Ca$^{2+}$ binding, yet cells show impaired oxidative metabolism and sensitization to Ca$^{2+}$ overload. Collectively, the data indicate that MICU1 senses the [Ca$^{2+}$]c to establish the uniporter's threshold and gain, thereby allowing mitochondria to properly decode different inputs.},

Nevertheless, regulation of mitochondrial activity is incompletely understood. Here we identified an unexpected and essential role for constitutive InsP(3)R-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release in maintaining cellular bioenergetics. Macroautophagy provides eukaryotes with an adaptive response to nutrient deprivation that prolongs survival. Constitutive InsP(3)R Ca$^{2+}$ signaling is required for macroautophagy suppression in cells in nutrient-replete media. In its absence, cells become metabolically compromised due to diminished mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. Mitochondrial uptake of InsP(3)R-released Ca$^{2+}$ is fundamentally required to provide optimal bioenergetics by providing sufficient reducing equivalents to support oxidative phosphorylation. Absence of this Ca$^{2+}$ transfer results in enhanced phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and activation of AMPK, which activates prosurvival macroautophagy. Thus, constitutive InsP(3)R Ca$^{2+}$ release to mitochondria is an essential cellular process that is required for efficient mitochondrial respiration and maintenance of normal cell bioenergetics.},

EMRE is a 10-kilodalton, metazoan-specific protein with a single transmembrane domain. In its absence, uniporter channel activity was lost despite intact MCU expression and oligomerization.

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ mobilisation by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) is a complex phenomenon which involves positive and negative feedback regulation by cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. It has been shown that Ca$^{2+}$ increased the affinity of [3H]-InsP3 binding to liver membranes and inhibited [3H]-InsP3 binding to cerebellar membranes. We investigated the effects of Ca$^{2+}$ on the [3H]-InsP3 binding to receptor solubilised and rapidly purified by immunoprecipitation. The InsP3 binding to the purified liver receptor was insensitive to the addition of Ca$^{2+}$, indicating that Ca$^{2+}$ did not interact directly with the receptor. The loss of the Ca$^{2+}$ effect on liver receptor affinity was reproduced by alkaline treatment of liver membranes, which is known to extract the peripheral membrane proteins. This suggests that Ca$^{2+}$ regulates the liver InsP3 receptor by interacting with a membrane-associated protein. Ca$^{2+}$ inhibited the binding of [3H]-InsP3 to purified cerebellar receptors as was found with the membrane fraction. The treatment of the purified cerebellar receptor with media of high ionic strength or at alkaline pH did not abolish the effect of Ca$^{2+}$ on the receptor. This indicates that the inhibitory effect of Ca$^{2+}$ on [3H]-InsP3 binding to cerebellar membranes occurs either via direct interaction with the receptor or via an integral protein strongly associated with the receptor. In conclusion, the mechanisms of regulation of InsP3-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release by Ca$^{2+}$ involve different molecular support in cerebellum and in liver. This may reflect different regulation dependent on the receptor type.},

abstract = {Pancreatic islets of Langerhans produce bursts of electrical activity when exposed to stimulatory glucose levels. These bursts often have a regular repeating pattern, with a period of 10-60 s. In some cases, however, the bursts are episodic, clustered into bursts of bursts, which we call compound bursting. Consistent with this are recordings of free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intraislet glucose levels that exhibit very slow oscillations, with faster oscillations superimposed. We describe a new mathematical model of the pancreatic beta-cell that can account for these multimodal patterns. The model includes the feedback of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ onto ion channels that can account for bursting, and a metabolic subsystem that is capable of producing slow oscillations driven by oscillations in glycolysis. This slow rhythm is responsible for the slow mode of compound bursting in the model. We also show that it is possible for glycolytic oscillations alone to drive a very slow form of bursting, which we call "glycolytic bursting." Finally, the model predicts that there is bistability between stationary and oscillatory glycolysis for a range of parameter values. We provide experimental support for this model prediction. Overall, the model can account for a diversity of islet behaviors described in the literature over the past 20 years.},

There is a wealth of knowledge around the role of presenilins as the catalytic component of $\gamma$-secretase, their involvement in amyloid precursor protein processing and generation of neurotoxic $\beta$-amyloid species. However recent findings have revealed a wide range of $\gamma$-secretase-independent presenilin functions, including involvement in calcium homeostasis. Particularly, familial Alzheimer's disease presenilin mutations have been shown to interfere with the function of several molecular elements involved in endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis.

abstract = {The relationship of extramitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ to intramitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ and the influence of intramitochondrial free Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations on various steps of the citric acid cycle were evaluated. Ca$^{2+}$ was measured using the Ca$^{2+}$ sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2 trapped inside the rat heart mitochondria. The rate of utilization of specific substrates and the rate of accumulation of citric acid cycle intermediates were measured at matrix free Ca$^{2+}$ ranging from 0 to 1.2 microM. A change in matrix free Ca$^{2+}$ from 0 to 0.3 microM caused a 135\% increase in ADP stimulated oxidation of 0.6 mM alpha-ketoglutarate (K0.5 = 0.15 microM). In the absence of ADP and the presence of 0.6 mM alpha-ketoglutarate, Ca$^{2+}$ (0.3 microM) increased NAD(H) reduction from 0 to 40\%. On the other hand, when pyruvate (10 microM to 5 mM) was substrate, pyruvate dehydrogenase flux was insensitive to Ca$^{2+}$ and isocitrate dehydrogenase was sensitive to Ca$^{2+}$ only in the presence of added ADP. In separate experiments pyruvate dehydrogenase activation (dephosphorylation) was measured. Under the conditions of the present study, pyruvate dehydrogenase was found to be almost 100\% activated at all levels of Ca$^{2+}$, thus explaining the Ca$^{2+}$ insensitivity of the flux measurements. However, if the mitochondria were incubated in the absence of pyruvate, with excess alpha-ketoglutarate and excess ATP, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was only 20\% active in the absence of added Ca$^{2+}$ and activity increased to 100\% at 2 microM Ca$^{2+}$. Activation by Ca$^{2+}$ required more Ca$^{2+}$ (K0.5 = 1 microM) than for alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The data suggest that in heart mitochondria alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase may be a more physiologically relevant target of Ca$^{2+}$ action than pyruvate dehydrogenase.},

abstract = {Tumour development requires a combination of defects that allow nascent neoplastic cells to become self-sufficient for cell proliferation and insensitive to signals that normally restrain cell growth. Among the latter, evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis) has proven to be critical for the development and sustained growth of many, perhaps all, cancers. Apoptotic cell death is regulated by complex interactions between pro-survival members and two subgroups of pro-apoptotic members of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein family. In this invited review article, we reminisce on the discovery of Bcl-2, the first regulator of cell death identified, we discuss the mechanisms that control apoptotic cell death, focussing on how defects in this process promote the development and sustained growth of tumours and also affect their responses to anticancer therapeutics and, finally, we describe how current knowledge of the regulatory networks of apoptosis is exploited to develop novel approaches for cancer therapy.},

@article{Mizzen1991,
abstract = {In mammalian cells, two of the so-called heat shock (hsp) or stress proteins are components of the mitochondria. One of these, hsp 58, is a member of the bacterial GroEL family, whereas the other, glucose-regulated protein (grp) 75, represents a member of the hsp 70 family of stress proteins. Owing to previous studies implicating a role for both the hsp 70 and GroEL families in facilitating protein maturation events, we used the method of native immunoprecipitation to examine whether hsp 58 and grp 75 might interact with other proteins of the mitochondria. In cells pulse-labeled with [35S]-methionine, a significant number of newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins co-precipitated with either hsp 58 or grp 75. Such interactions appeared transient. For example, providing the pulse-labeled cells a subsequent chase period in the absence of radiolabel resulted in a reduction of co-precipitating proteins. If the pulse-chase labeling experiments were performed in the presence of an amino acid analogue, somewhat different results were obtained. Specifically, although many of the newly synthesized and analogue-containing proteins again were observed to co-precipitate with grp 75, the interactions did not appear transient, but instead were stable. Under steady-state labeling conditions, we also observed a portion of hsp 58 and grp 75 in an apparent complex with one another. On addition of ATP, the complex was dissociated. Accompanying this dissociation was the concomitant autophosphorylation of grp 75. On the basis of these observations, as well as previous studies examining the structure/function of the hsp 70 and GroEL proteins, we suspect that both hsp 58 and grp 75 interact with and facilitate the folding and assembly of proteins as they enter into the mitochondria.},

Because of the extensive endoplasmic reticulum and the large granular compartment, it has been possible--by direct measurements--to obtain considerable insights into intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ handling under both normal and pathological conditions. Recent studies have also revealed important characteristics of stimulus-secretion coupling mechanisms in isolated human pancreatic acinar cells. The acinar cells are potentially dangerous because of the high intra-granular concentration of proteases, which become inappropriately activated in the human disease acute pancreatitis. This disease is due to toxic Ca$^{2+}$ signals generated by excessive liberation of Ca$^{2+}$ from both the endoplasmic reticulum and the secretory granules.},

We demonstrate that VDAC1 is physically linked to the endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{2+}$-release channel inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) through the molecular chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (grp75). Functional interaction between the channels was shown by the recombinant expression of the ligand-binding domain of the IP(3)R on the ER or mitochondrial surface, which directly enhanced Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation in mitochondria. Knockdown of grp75 abolished the stimulatory effect, highlighting chaperone-mediated conformational coupling between the IP(3)R and the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake machinery. Because organelle Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis influences fundamentally cellular functions and death signaling, the central location of grp75 may represent an important control point of cell fate and pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Most important processes in cell life are regulated by calcium (Ca$^{2+}$). A number of mechanisms have thus been developed to maintain the concentration of free Ca$^{2+}$ inside cells at the level (100-200nM) necessary for the optimal operation of the targets of its regulatory function. The systems that move Ca$^{2+}$ back and forth across membranes are important actors in its control. The plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA pump) which ejects Ca$^{2+}$ from all eukaryotic cell types will be the topic of this contribution. The pump uses a molecule of ATP to transport one molecule of Ca$^{2+}$ from the cytosol to the external environment. It is a P-type ATPase encoded by four genes (ATP2B1-4), the transcripts of which undergo different types of alternative splicing. Many pump variants thus exist. Their multiplicity is best explained by the specific Ca$^{2+}$ demands in different cell types. In keeping with these demands, the isoforms are differently expressed in tissues and cell types and have differential Ca$^{2+}$ extruding properties. At very low Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations the PMCAs are nearly inactive. They must be activated by calmodulin, by acid phospholipids, by protein kinases, and by other means, e.g., a dimerization process. Other proteins interact with the PMCAs (i.e., MAGUK and NHERF at the PDZ domain and calcineurin A in the main intracellular domain) to sort them to specific regions of the cell membrane or to regulate their function. In some cases the interaction is isoform, or even splice variant specific. PMCAs knock out (KO) mice have been generated and have contributed information on the importance of PMCAs to cells and organisms. So far, only one human genetic disease, hearing loss, has been traced back to a PMCA defect.},

abstract = {It is known that Ca$^{2+}$ influx plays an important role in the modulation of inositol trisphosphate-generated Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations, but controversy over the mechanisms underlying these effects exists. In addition, the effects of blocking membrane transport or reducing Ca$^{2+}$ entry vary from one cell type to another; in some cell types oscillations persist in the absence of Ca$^{2+}$ entry (although their frequency is affected), whereas in other cell types oscillations depend on Ca$^{2+}$ entry. We present theoretical and experimental evidence that membrane transport can control oscillations by controlling the total amount of Ca$^{2+}$ in the cell (the Ca$^{2+}$ load). Our model predicts that the cell can be balanced at a point where small changes in the Ca$^{2+}$ load can move the cell into or out of oscillatory regions, resulting in the appearance or disappearance of oscillations. Our theoretical predictions are verified by experimental results from HEK293 cells. We predict that the role of Ca$^{2+}$ influx during an oscillation is to replenish the Ca$^{2+}$ load of the cell. Despite this prediction, even during the peak of an oscillation the cell or the endoplasmic reticulum may not be measurably depleted of Ca$^{2+}$.},

abstract = {The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) transports free ionic Ca$^{2+}$ into the mitochondrial matrix. We assessed MCU expression in clinical breast cancer samples using microarray analysis and the consequences of MCU silencing in a breast cancer cell line. Our results indicate that estrogen receptor negative and basal-like breast cancers are characterized by elevated levels of MCU. Silencing of MCU expression in the basal-like MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line produced no change in proliferation or cell viability. However, distinct consequences of MCU silencing were seen on cell death pathways. Caspase-dependent cell death initiated by the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-263 was not altered by MCU silencing; whereas caspase-independent cell death induced by the calcium ionophore ionomycin was potentiated by MCU silencing. Measurement of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ levels showed that the promotion of ionomycin-induced cell death by MCU silencing occurs independently of changes in bulk cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ levels. This study demonstrates that MCU overexpression is a feature of some breast cancers and that MCU overexpression may offer a survival advantage against some cell death pathways. MCU inhibitors may be a strategy to increase the effectiveness of therapies that act through the induction of caspase-independent cell death pathways in estrogen receptor negative and basal-like breast cancers.},

The structures reveal that a four-residue C-terminal stretch (X-Thr/Ser-X-Val-COO(-)) engages the PDZ domain through antiparallel main chain interactions with a beta sheet of the domain. Recognition of the terminal carboxylate group of the peptide is conferred by a cradle of main chain amides provided by a Gly-Leu-Gly-Phe loop as well as by an arginine side chain. Specific side chain interactions and a prominent hydrophobic pocket explain the selective recognition of the C-terminal consensus sequence.},

abstract = {Human and murine STIM1 were originally discovered as candidate growth regulators in tumours and in the bone marrow stroma, and the structurally related vertebrate family members, STIM2 and the Drosophila homologue D-Stim, were subsequently identified. STIM proteins are ubiquitously expressed type I single-pass transmembrane proteins which have a unique combination of structural motifs within their polypeptide sequences. The extracellular regions contain an N-terminal unpaired EF-hand Ca$^{2+}$ binding motif adjacent to an unconventional glycosylated SAM domain, while the cytoplasmic regions contain alpha-helical coiled-coil domains within a region having homology to ERM domains adjacent to the transmembrane region, and phosphorylated proline-rich domains near the C-terminus. STIM1, STIM2 and D-Stim diverge significantly only in their structure C-terminal to the coiled-coil/ERM domains. The STIM structural domains were predicted to function in Ca$^{2+}$ binding as well as in mediating interactions between STIM proteins and other proteins, and homotypic STIM1-STIM1 and heterotypic STIM1-STIM2 interactions were demonstrated biochemically. However, the functional significance of the cellular localisation of STIM1 and its domain structure only became evident after recent breakthrough research identified STIM1 as a key regulator of store-operated calcium (SOC) entry into cells. It is now clear that STIM1 is both a sensor of Ca$^{2+}$ depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and an activator of Orai1-containing SOC channels in the plasma membrane. On the basis of recent functional studies a model can be proposed to explain how the biochemical properties of STIM1 contribute to its precise membrane localisation and its function in regulating SOC entry.},

Within each region, neurons are connected to each other to form neural circuits of bewildering complexity. To function in such circuits, each neuron must receive and process information entering from one set of neurons and then relay signals to other neurons in the circuit. The neuronal processes of signal reception and transmission are key elements of neuronal function and are located at opposite ends of the neuron. Specific attention will be focused on the operation of neural circuits in regions such as the hippocampus , cortex , cerebellum and the respiratory cent re in the brainstem. Neural circuits are established during development and remain relatively constant throughout adult life. The only exception in humans is the hippocampus, where the neuronal elements of the circuit are constantly being replaced by a process of neurogenesis .},

abstract = {Signal-induced Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations have been observed in many cell types and play a primary role in cell physiology. Although it is the regular character of these oscillations that first catches the attention, a closer look at time series of Ca$^{2+}$ increases reveals that the fluctuations on the period during individual spike trains are far from negligible. Here, we perform a statistical analysis of the regularity of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in norepinephrine-stimulated hepatocytes and find that the coefficient of variation lies between 10\% and 15\%. Stochastic simulations based on Gillespie's algorithm and considering realistic numbers of Ca$^{2+}$ ions and inositol trisphosphate (InsP(3)) receptors account for this variability if the receptors are assumed to be grouped in clusters of a few tens of channels. Given the relatively small number of clusters ( approximately 200), the model predicts the existence of repetitive spikes induced by fluctuations (stochastic resonance). Oscillations of this type are found in hepatocytes at subthreshold concentrations of norepinephrine. We next predict with the model that the isoforms of the InsP(3) receptor can affect the variability of the oscillations. In contrast, possible accompanying InsP(3) oscillations have no impact on the robustness of signal-induced repetitive Ca$^{2+}$ spikes.},

abstract = {There is considerable evidence that the voltage-gated mitochondrial channel VDAC forms a beta-barrel pore. Inferences about the number and tilt of beta-strands can be drawn from comparisons with bacterial beta-barrel pores whose structures have been determined by x-ray crystallography. A structural model for VDAC is proposed (based on sequence analysis and electron crystallography) in which the open state is like that of bacterial porins with several important differences. Because VDAC does not occur as close-packed trimers, there are probably fewer interpore contacts than in the bacterial porins. VDAC also appears to lack a large, fixed intraluminal segment and may not have as extensive a region of uniformly 35 degrees -tilted beta-strands as do the bacterial porins. These structural differences would be expected to render VDAC's beta-barrel less stable than its bacterial counterparts, making major conformational changes like those associated with gating more energetically feasible. A possible gating mechanism is suggested in which movement of the N-terminal alpha-helix out of the lumen wall triggers larger-scale structural changes.},

abstract = {The origin of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]i) transients stimulated by nicotinic (nAChR) and muscarinic (mAChR) receptor activation was investigated in fura-2-loaded neonatal rat intracardiac neurons. ACh evoked [Ca$^{2+}$]i increases that were reduced to approximately 60\% of control in the presence of either atropine (1 microM) or mecamylamine (3 microM) and to <20\% in the presence of both antagonists. Removal of external Ca$^{2+}$ reduced ACh-induced responses to 58\% of control, which was unchanged in the presence of mecamylamine but reduced to 5\% of control by atropine. The nAChR-induced [Ca$^{2+}$]i response was reduced to 50\% by 10 microM ryanodine, whereas the mAChR-induced response was unaffected by ryanodine, suggesting that Ca$^{2+}$ release from ryanodine-sensitive Ca$^{2+}$ stores may only contribute to the nAChR-induced [Ca$^{2+}$]i responses. Perforated-patch whole cell recording at -60 mV shows that the rise in [Ca$^{2+}$]i is concomitant with slow outward currents on mAChR activation and with rapid inward currents after nAChR activation. In conclusion, different signaling pathways mediate the rise in [Ca$^{2+}$]i and membrane currents evoked by ACh binding to nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in rat intracardiac neurons.},

@article{Gautier2011,
abstract = {Bcl-2 homologues (such as Bcl-x(L)) promote survival in part through sequestration of "activator" BH3-only proteins (such as Puma), preventing them from directly activating Bax. It is thus assumed that inhibition of interactions between activators and Bcl-x(L) is a prerequisite for small molecules to antagonize Bcl-x(L) and induce cell death. The biological properties, described here of a terphenyl-based alpha-helical peptidomimetic inhibitor of Bcl-x(L) attest that displacement of Bax from Bcl-x(L) is also critical. Terphenyl 14 triggers Bax-dependent but Puma-independent cell death, disrupting Bax/Bcl-x(L) interactions without affecting Puma/Bcl-x(L) interactions. In cell-free assays, binding of inactive Bax to Bcl-x(L), followed by its displacement from Bcl-x(L) by terphenyl 14, produces mitochondrially permeabilizing Bax molecules. Moreover, the peptidomimetic kills yeast cells that express Bax and Bcl-x(L), and it uses Bax-binding Bcl-x(L) to induce mammalian cell death. Likewise, ectopic expression of Bax in yeast and mammalian cells enhances sensitivity to another Bcl-x(L) inhibitor, ABT-737, when Bcl-x(L) is present. Thus, the interaction of Bcl-x(L) with Bax paradoxically primes Bax at the same time it keeps Bax activity in check, and displacement of Bax from Bcl-x(L) triggers an apoptotic signal by itself. This mechanism might contribute to the clinical efficiency of Bcl-x(L) inhibitors.},

The region has emerged as the primary area of Ca$^{2+}$ traffic between the two organelles, and as such, has been implicated in the regulation of protein folding, oxidative phosphorylation, and Ca$^{2+}$-mediated apoptosis. In order to better understand biological processes and molecular functions at the MAM, we report a global mass spectrometry-based proteomic evaluation of the MAM obtained from mouse brain samples. Gel-assisted sample preparation in conjunction with our two-dimensional chromatography approach allowed for the identification of 1,212 high confidence proteins. Bioinformatic interrogation of this protein catalogue using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed new potential connections between our list of MAM proteins and neurodegenerative diseases in addition to anticipated biological processes. Based on our results, we postulate that proteins of the MAM may play essential roles in dysfunctions responsible for several neurological disorders in addition to facilitating key cellular survival processes.},

@article{Griffiths2009,
abstract = {Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport was initially considered important only in buffering of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ by acting as a "sink" under conditions of Ca$^{2+}$ overload. The main regulator of ATP production was considered to be the relative concentrations of high energy phosphates. However, work by Denton and McCormack in the 1970s and 1980s showed that free intramitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ ([Ca$^{2+}$](m)) activated dehydrogenase enzymes in mitochondria, leading to increased NADH and hence ATP production. This leads them to propose a scheme, subsequently termed a "parallel activation model" whereby increases in energy demand, such as hormonal stimulation or increased workload in muscle, produced an increase in cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] that was relayed by the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transporters into the matrix to give an increase in [Ca$^{2+}$](m). This then stimulated energy production to meet the increased energy demand. With the development of methods for measuring [Ca$^{2+}$](m) in living cells that proved [Ca$^{2+}$](m) changed over a dynamic physiological range rather than simply soaking up excess cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$], this model has now gained widespread acceptance. However, work by ourselves and others using targeted probes to measure changes in both [Ca$^{2+}$] and [ATP] in different cell compartments has revealed variations in the interrelationships between these two in different tissues, suggesting that metabolic regulation by Ca$^{2+}$ is finely tuned to the demands and function of the individual organ.},

abstract = {Recent evidence underlines a key role of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ fluxes in cell Ca$^{2+}$ signalling. We present here a kinetic model simulating the Ca$^{2+}$ fluxes generated by mitochondria during mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release (mCICR) resulting from the operation of the permeability transition pore (PTP). Our model connects the Ca$^{2+}$ fluxes through the ruthenium redsensitive Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter, the respiration-dependent and passive H+ fluxes, the rate of oxygen consumption, the movements of weak acids across the mitochondrial membrane, the electrical transmembrane potential (delta psi), and operation of the PTP. We find that two factors are crucial to account for the various mCICR profiles that can be observed experimentally: (i) the dependence of PTP opening and closure on matrix pH (pHi), and (ii) the relative inhibition of the respiratory rate consecutive to PTP opening. The resulting model can simulate irreversible Ca$^{2+}$ efflux from mitochondria, as well as the genesis of damped or sustained Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations, and of single Ca$^{2+}$ spikes. The model also simulates the main features of mCICR, i.e. the threshold-dependence of mCICR triggering, and the all-or-nothing nature of mCICR operation. Our model should appear useful to further mathematically address the consequences of mCICR on the spatiotemporal organisation of Ca$^{2+}$ signals, as a 'plug-in' module for the existing models of cell Ca$^{2+}$ signalling.},

abstract = {The mitochondrial permeability transition is an increase of permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to ions and solutes with an exclusion size of about 1500Da. It is generally accepted that the permeability transition is due to opening of a high-conductance channel, the permeability transition pore. Although the molecular nature of the permeability transition pore remains undefined, a great deal is known about its regulation and role in pathophysiology. This review specifically covers the characterization of the permeability transition pore by chemical modification of specific residues through photoirradiation of mitochondria after treatment with porphyrins. The review also illustrates the basic principles of the photodynamic effect and the mechanisms of phototoxicity and discusses the unique properties of singlet oxygen generated by specific porphyrins in discrete mitochondrial domains. These experiments provided remarkable information on the role, interactions and topology of His and Cys residues in permeability transition pore modulation and defined an important role for the outer membrane 18kDa translocator protein (formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) in regulation of the permeability transition.},

abstract = {Microdomains of Ca$^{2+}$, which are formed at sites where Ca$^{2+}$ enters the cytoplasm either at the cell surface or at the internal stores, are a key element of Ca$^{2+}$ signalling. The term microdomain includes the elementary events that are the basic building blocks of Ca$^{2+}$ signals. As Ca$^{2+}$ enters the cytoplasm, it produces a local plume of Ca$^{2+}$ that has been given different names (sparks, puffs, sparklets and syntillas). These elementary events can combine to produce larger microdomains. The significance of these localized domains of Ca$^{2+}$ is that they can regulate specific cellular processes in different regions of the cell. Such microdomains are particularly evident in neurons where both pre- and postsynaptic events are controlled by highly localized pulses of Ca$^{2+}$. The ability of single neurons to process enormous amounts of information depends upon such miniaturization of the Ca$^{2+}$ signalling system. Control of cardiac cell contraction and gene transcription provides another example of how the parallel processing of Ca$^{2+}$ signalling can occur through microdomains of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is conserved from yeast to humans that plays an important role in recycling cellular constituents in all cells. A number of protein complexes and signaling pathways impinge on the regulation of autophagy, with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as the central player in the canonical pathway. Cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling also regulates autophagy, with both activating and inhibitory effects, mediated by the canonical as well as non-canonical pathways. Here we review this regulation, with a focus on the role of an mTOR-independent pathway that involves the inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R) Ca$^{2+}$ release channel and Ca$^{2+}$ signaling to mitochondria. Constitutive InsP(3)R Ca$^{2+}$ transfer to mitochondria is required for autophagy suppression in cells in nutrient-replete media. In its absence, cells become metabolically compromised due to insufficient production of reducing equivalents to support oxidative phosphorylation. Absence of this Ca$^{2+}$ transfer to mitochondria results in activation of AMPK, which activates mTOR-independent pro-survival autophagy. Constitutive InsP(3)R Ca$^{2+}$ release to mitochondria is an essential cellular process that is required for efficient mitochondrial respiration, maintenance of normal cell bioenergetics and suppression of autophagy.},

This approach gave novel information on different aspects of cellular Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis. Regarding mitochondria, it was possible to demonstrate that, upon physiological stimulation of cells, Ca$^{2+}$ is rapidly accumulated in the matrix. We will discuss the basic characteristics of this process, its role in modulating physiological and pathological events, such as the regulation of aerobic metabolism and the induction of cell death, and new insight into the regulatory mechanisms operating in vivo.},

abstract = {Mitochondria participate in intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ buffering and signalling. They are also major mediators of cell death. Toxic Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation in mitochondria is widely believed to initiate cell death in many cell types by opening the permeability transition pore (PTP). In non-neuronal cells, the PTP has been implicated as a Ca$^{2+}$ release mechanism in physiological Ca$^{2+}$ signalling. In neurons, Ca$^{2+}$ release from mitochondria has been attributed primarily to mitochondrial Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange. Using fura-2 ratiometric microfluorimetry in acutely dissociated rat basal forebrain neurons, we show that mitochondria are able to buffer non-toxic Ca$^{2+}$ loads arising from caffeine-sensitive internal stores or from extracellular influx through voltage gated channels. We also show that these non-toxic Ca$^{2+}$ loads are reversibly released from mitochondria through the PTP and the Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger. Evoked Ca$^{2+}$ transients have characteristic peak and shoulder features mediated by mitochondrial buffering and release. Depolarizing mitochondria with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, 5 microM) causes release of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ and prevents Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. In CCCP, the magnitudes of evoked Ca$^{2+}$ transients are increased, and the peak and shoulder features are eliminated. The PTP antagonist, cyclosporin A, (CSA, 2 microM) and the Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange blocker, clonazepam, (CLO, 20 microM) reversibly inhibited both the shoulder features of evoked Ca$^{2+}$ transients and Ca$^{2+}$ transients associated with CCCP application. We suggest that central neuronal mitochondria buffer and release Ca$^{2+}$ through the PTP and Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger during physiological Ca$^{2+}$ signalling. We also suggest that CLO blocks both the PTP and the mitochondrial Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger.},

abstract = {1. In single, dissociated, rat parotid acinar cells the muscarinic agonist carbachol evokes a rapid rise in cytosolic free calcium [( Ca$^{2+}$]i), from near 100 nM to peak levels of up to 1 microM. In the continued presence of the agonist the response decays to a lower, maintained, level. 2. In most cells, at 22 degrees C, oscillations, with a mean frequency of 0.19 Hz, are superimposed upon this elevation of [Ca$^{2+}$]i. In voltage-clamped cells oscillations of current occur in phase with the oscillations of [Ca$^{2+}$]i. 3. The oscillations occur in voltage-clamped cells, and in the absence of extracellular Ca$^{2+}$, indicating that neither voltage-gated processes, or an influx of Ca$^{2+}$ is involved. 4. Oscillation frequency is independent of carbachol concentration, in the range 100 nM to 250 microM, and furthermore, shows no relationship to the mean level of [Ca$^{2+}$]i during the oscillations. 5. Stimulation with the alpha-adrenergic agonist noradrenaline, in the presence of the beta-blocker propanolol, evokes oscillations having the same frequency as those evoked by carbachol. 6. The oscillations show a strong temperature dependence, the frequency increasing with a Q10 of 2.8. In contrast, the amplitude of the oscillations drops from a mean of 33\% of the response amplitude at 22 degrees C, and below, to 6\% at 33 degrees C. Above the latter temperature oscillations are not resolvable. 7. The phorbol esters, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate and 12,13-phorbol dibutyrate (1 microM), do not affect the response to carbachol at 22 degrees C, at which temperature the oscillations are of maximum amplitude. Diacylglycerol is, therefore, unlikely to be involved in oscillation generation in these cells. 8. These observations are consistent with a model in which a negative feed-back loop links [Ca$^{2+}$]i to the mechanisms of Ca$^{2+}$ elevation, possibly to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca$^{2+}$ release mechanism of the endoplasmic reticulum. If the feed-back path involved an enzymatic step, the slowing of this step at lowered temperatures could give rise to oscillations. At body temperature such a mechanism would act to ensure that [Ca$^{2+}$]i was elevated in a regulated and dose-dependent manner.},

These channel clusters are of unknown size or geometrical characteristics. The aim of this study was to estimate the number of channels and the interchannel distance within such a cluster. Because these characteristics are not attainable experimentally, we performed computer stochastic simulations of Ca$^{2+}$ release events. We conclude that, to ensure efficient interchannel communication, as experimentally observed, a typical cluster should contain two or three tens of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca$^{2+}$ channels in close contact.},

abstract = {Chondrogenesis is known to be regulated by calcium-dependent signalling pathways in which temporal aspects of calcium homeostasis are of key importance. We aimed to better characterise calcium influx and release functions with respect to rapid calcium oscillations in cells of chondrifying chicken high density cultures. We found that differentiating chondrocytes express the $\alpha$1 subunit of voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) at both mRNA and protein levels, and that these ion channels play important roles in generating Ca$^{2+}$ influx for oscillations as nifedipine interfered with repetitive calcium transients. Furthermore, VOCC blockade abrogated chondrogenesis and almost completely blocked cell proliferation. The contribution of internal Ca$^{2+}$ stores via store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ entry (SOCE) seems to be indispensable to both Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations and chondrogenesis. Moreover, this is the first study to show the functional expression of STIM1/STIM2 and Orai1, molecules that orchestrate SOCE, in chondrogenic cells. Inhibition of SOCE combined with ER calcium store depletion abolished differentiation and severely diminished proliferation, suggesting the important role of internal pools in calcium homeostasis of differentiating chondrocytes. Finally, we present an integrated model for the regulation of calcium oscillations of differentiating chondrocytes that may have important implications for studies of chondrogenesis induced in various stem cell populations.},

abstract = {Transmission of cytosolic [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$]c) oscillations into the mitochondrial matrix is thought to be supported by local calcium control between IP3 receptor Ca$^{2+}$ channels (IP3R) and mitochondria, but study of the coupling mechanisms has been difficult. We established a permeabilized cell model in which the Ca$^{2+}$ coupling between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria is retained, and mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) can be monitored by fluorescence imaging. We demonstrate that maximal activation of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake is evoked by IP3-induced perimitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] elevations, which appear to reach values >20-fold higher than the global increases of [Ca$^{2+}$]c. Incremental doses of IP3 elicited [Ca$^{2+}$]m elevations that followed the quantal pattern of Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization, even at the level of individual mitochondria. In contrast, gradual increases of IP3 evoked relatively small [Ca$^{2+}$]m responses despite eliciting similar [Ca$^{2+}$]c increases. We conclude that each mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake site faces multiple IP3R, a concurrent activation of which is required for optimal activation of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. This architecture explains why calcium oscillations evoked by synchronized periodic activation of IP3R are particularly effective in establishing dynamic control over mitochondrial metabolism. Furthermore, our data reveal fundamental functional similarities between ER-mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ coupling and synaptic transmission.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial calcium uptake has a central role in cell physiology by stimulating ATP production, shaping cytosolic calcium transients and regulating cell death. The biophysical properties of mitochondrial calcium uptake have been studied in detail, but the underlying proteins remain elusive. Here we use an integrative strategy to predict human genes involved in mitochondrial calcium entry based on clues from comparative physiology, evolutionary genomics and organelle proteomics. RNA interference against 13 top candidates highlighted one gene, CBARA1, that we call hereafter mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1). Silencing MICU1 does not disrupt mitochondrial respiration or membrane potential but abolishes mitochondrial calcium entry in intact and permeabilized cells, and attenuates the metabolic coupling between cytosolic calcium transients and activation of matrix dehydrogenases. MICU1 is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and has two canonical EF hands that are essential for its activity, indicating a role in calcium sensing. MICU1 represents the founding member of a set of proteins required for high-capacity mitochondrial calcium uptake. Its discovery may lead to the complete molecular characterization of mitochondrial calcium uptake pathways, and offers genetic strategies for understanding their contribution to normal physiology and disease.},

One of the nucleases primarily responsible for genomic DNA fragmentation during apoptosis is called DNA Fragmentation Factor 40 (DFF40) or Caspase-activated DNase (CAD). DFF40/CAD is a magnesium-dependent endonuclease specific for double stranded DNA that generates double strand breaks with 3'-hydroxyl ends. DFF40/CAD is activated by caspase-3 that cuts the nuclease's inhibitor DFF45/ICAD. The nuclease preferentially attacks chromatin in the internucleosomal linker DNA. However, the nuclease hypersensitive sites can be detected and DFF40/CAD is potentially involved in large-scale DNA fragmentation as well. DFF40/CAD-mediated DNA fragmentation triggers chromatin condensation that is another hallmark of apoptosis.},

It is also a signalling molecule in the purinergic signalling mechanisms.

@article{Hoth1997,
abstract = {Mitochondria act as potent buffers of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ in many cells, but a more active role in modulating the generation of Ca$^{2+}$ signals is not well established. We have investigated the ability of mitochondria to modulate store-operated or "capacitative" Ca$^{2+}$ entry in Jurkat leukemic T cells and human T lymphocytes using fluorescence imaging techniques. Depletion of the ER Ca$^{2+}$ store with thapsigargin (TG) activates Ca$^{2+}$ release-activated Ca$^{2+}$ (CRAC) channels in T cells, and the ensuing influx of Ca$^{2+}$ loads a TG-insensitive intracellular store that by several criteria appears to be mitochondria. Loading of this store is prevented by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or by antimycin A1 + oligomycin, agents that are known to inhibit mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ import by dissipating the mitochondrial membrane potential. Conversely, intracellular Na$^+$ depletion, which inhibits Na$^+$-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ export from mitochondria, enhances store loading. In addition, we find that rhod-2 labels mitochondria in T cells, and it reports changes in Ca$^{2+}$ levels that are consistent with its localization in the TG-insensitive store. Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by the mitochondrial store is sensitive (threshold is <400 nM cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$), rapid (detectable within 8 s), and does not readily saturate. The rate of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake is sensitive to extracellular [Ca$^{2+}$], indicating that mitochondria sense Ca$^{2+}$ gradients near CRAC channels. Remarkably, mitochondrial uncouplers or Na$^+$ depletion prevent the ability of T cells to maintain a high rate of capacitative Ca$^{2+}$ entry over prolonged periods of >10 min. Under these conditions, the rate of Ca$^{2+}$ influx in single cells undergoes abrupt transitions from a high influx to a low influx state. These results demonstrate that mitochondria not only buffer the Ca$^{2+}$ that enters T cells via store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ channels, but also play an active role in modulating the rate of capacitative Ca$^{2+}$ entry.},

The ability of a simple ion such as Ca$^{2+}$ to play a pivotal role in cell biology results from the facility that cells have to shape Ca$^{2+}$ signals in space, time and amplitude. To generate and interpret the variety of observed Ca$^{2+}$ signals, different cell types employ components selected from a Ca$^{2+}$ signalling 'toolkit', which comprises an array of homeostatic and sensory mechanisms. By mixing and matching components from the toolkit, cells can obtain Ca$^{2+}$ signals that suit their physiology. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of local Ca$^{2+}$ signals in defining the specificity of the interaction of Ca$^{2+}$ with its targets. Furthermore, local Ca$^{2+}$ signals are the triggers and building blocks for larger global signals that propagate throughout cells.},

abstract = {The inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) are the major intracellular Ca$^{2+}$-release channels in cells. Activity of InsP3Rs is essential for elementary and global Ca$^{2+}$ events in the cell. There are three InsP3Rs isoforms that are present in mammalian cells. In this review we will focus primarily on InsP3R type 1. The InsP3R1 is a predominant isoform in neurons and it is the most extensively studied isoform. Combination of biophysical and structural methods revealed key mechanisms of InsP3R function and modulation. Cell biological and biochemical studies lead to identification of a large number of InsP3R-binding proteins. InsP3Rs are involved in the regulation of numerous physiological processes, including learning and memory, proliferation, differentiation, development and cell death. Malfunction of InsP3R1 play a role in a number of neurodegenerative disorders and other disease states. InsP3Rs represent a potentially valuable drug target for treatment of these disorders and for modulating activity of neurons and other cells. Future studies will provide better understanding of physiological functions of InsP3Rs in health and disease.},

abstract = {Activation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP(3)Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) can lead to the release of Ca$^{2+}$ from intracellular stores and propagating Ca$^{2+}$ waves. Previous studies of these proteins in neurons have focused on their distribution in adult tissue, whereas, recent functional studies have examined neural tissue extracted from prenatal and young postnatal animals. In this study we examined the distribution of InsP(3)R isotypes 1-3 and RyR isotypes 1-3 in rat hippocampus during postnatal maturation, with a focus on InsP(3)R1 because it is most prominent in the hippocampus. InsP(3)R1 was observed in pyramidal cells and granule cells, InsP(3)R2 immunoreactivity was observed in perivascular astrocytes and endothelial cells, and InsP(3)R3 immunoreactivity was detected in axon terminals located in stratum pyramidale of CA1 and microvessels in stratum radiatum. RyR1 immunolabeling was enriched in CA1, RyR2 was most intense in CA3 and the dentate gyrus, and RyR3 immunolabeling was detected in all subfields of the hippocampus, but was most intense in stratum lacunosum-moleculare. During maturation from 2 to 10 weeks of age there was a shift in InsP(3)R1 immunoreactivity from a high density in the proximal apical dendrites to a uniform distribution along the dendrites. Independent of age, InsP(3)R1 immunoreactivity was observed to form clusters within the primary apical dendrite and at dendritic bifurcations of pyramidal neurons. As CA1 pyramidal neurons matured, InsP(3)R1 was often co-localized with the Ca$^{2+}$ binding protein calbindin D-28k. In contrast, InsP(3)R1 immunolabel was never co-localized with calbindin D-28k immunopositive interneurons located outside of stratum pyramidale or with parvalbumin, typically found in hippocampal basket cells, suggesting that InsP(3)R1s do not play a role in internal Ca$^{2+}$ release in these interneurons. These findings should help to interpret past functional studies and inform future studies examining the characteristics and consequences of InsP(3)R-mediated internal Ca$^{2+}$ release and Ca$^{2+}$ waves in hippocampal neurons.},

abstract = {Net Ca$^{2+}$ uptake into intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ stores of homogenized cells is transient, even when the extravesicular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration is kept constant. To study the mechanism underlying the phenomenon, we have investigated 45Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by HL-60 cell homogenates. The initial rate of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake as well as the final amount of stored Ca$^{2+}$ were a function of the extravesicular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration. However, Ca$^{2+}$ uptake stopped independently of the extravesicular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration after approximately 10 min. Studies using Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase inhibitors demonstrated that the transient nature of the net uptake was not due to Ca$^{2+}$ efflux. Monovalent cation ionophores did not influence the Ca$^{2+}$ uptake curves, excluding a relevant involvement of pH and membrane potential. Together with the observation of a continued Ca$^{2+}$ uptake in the presence of the intralumenal Ca$^{2+}$ chelator oxalate, these results strongly suggest a feedback inhibition of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by the Ca$^{2+}$ load of intracellular stores. The concentration-inhibition relationship between the Ca$^{2+}$ load and the rate of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake was highly supralinear (slope factor >/= 4). IC50 and maximum of the dose-inhibition curve, but not the slope factor were a function of the extravesicular free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration. A series of three logistic equations derived from our data allowed an appropriate description of the behavior of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. Our results suggest, in addition to its well known activation by cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration, a highly supralinear feedback inhibition of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by the Ca$^{2+}$ load of intracellular stores. The steepness of the feedback inhibition might have a profound effect on spatial and temporal behavior of the Ca$^{2+}$ signal.},

abstract = {The peptide omega-agatoxin-IIIA (omega-Aga-IIIA) from venom of the funnel web spider Agelenopsis aperta is the only known agent that blocks L-type and N-type Ca channels with equal high potency (IC50 < or = 1 nM). From the same venom, we have purified and sequenced a family of peptides which are homologous to omega-Aga-IIIA but vary over 100-fold in their relative affinity for L-type versus N-type Ca channels. One of these, omega-Aga-IIIB, is 76 amino acids long and identical to omega-Aga-IIIA in 66 positions. We identified two other similar peptides, omega-Aga-IIIC and omega-Aga-IIID, as well as one single amino acid variant of omega-Aga-IIIA and two of omega-Aga-IIIB. The type III omega-agatoxins exhibit similar but distinct activities on voltage-gated Ca channels. omega-Aga-IIIA, omega-Aga-IIIB, and omega-Aga-IIID are nearly indistinguishable in their actions at the insect neuromuscular junction (no effect at 0.1 microM), on atrial T-type Ca channels (no effect at 0.5 microM), and in two assays for synaptosomal Ca channels: they are nearly equipotent inhibitors of 125I-omega-conotoxin GVIA binding to rat brain synaptic membranes (IC50 = 0.17-0.33 nM) and blockers of the K(+)-induced 45Ca$^{2+}$ influx into chick brain synaptosomes (omega-Aga-IIIB, 1.2 nM; omega-Aga-IIIA, 2.4 nM). In contrast, omega-Aga-IIIA is a better blocker of locust Ca channels (IC50 approximately 10-50 nM) than is omega-Aga-IIIB. Finally, although omega-Aga-IIIA, omega-Aga-IIIB, and omega-Aga-IIID all block atrial L-type Ca channels, omega-Aga-IIIA is over 100-fold more potent. Thus, although type III omega-agatoxins appear to recognize a binding site common to L- and N-type Ca channels, omega-Aga-IIIB and omega-Aga-IIID identify differences between the two channels.},

Release of Ca$^{2+}$ by InsP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) plays a central role in many of these signalling systems. Ongoing transcriptional processes maintain the integrity and stability of these cell-specific signalling systems. However, these homoeostatic systems are highly plastic and can undergo a process of phenotypic remodelling, resulting in the Ca$^{2+}$ signals being set either too high or too low. Such subtle dysregulation of Ca$^{2+}$ signals have been linked to some of the major diseases in humans such as cardiac disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Powered by the steep mitochondrial membrane potential Ca$^{2+}$ permeates into the mitochondria via the Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter and is then extruded by a mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger. This mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ shuttling regulates the rate of ATP production and participates in cellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling. Despite the fact that the exchanger was functionally identified 40 years ago its molecular identity remained a mystery. Early studies on isolated mitochondria and intact cells characterized the functional properties of a mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger, and showed that it possess unique functional fingerprints such as Li(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange and that it is displaying selective sensitivity to inhibitors. Purification of mitochondria proteins combined with functional reconstitution led to the isolation of a polypeptide candidate of the exchanger but failed to molecularly identify it. A turning point in the search for the exchanger molecule came with the recent cloning of the last member of the Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger superfamily termed NCLX (Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$/Li(+) exchanger). NCLX is localized in the inner mitochondria membrane and its expression is linked to mitochondria Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange matching the functional fingerprints of the putative mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger. Thus NCLX emerges as the long sought mitochondria Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger and provide a critical molecular handle to study mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ signaling and transport. Here we summarize some of the main topics related to the molecular properties of the Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger, beginning with the early days of its functional identification, its kinetic properties and regulation, and culminating in its molecular identification.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) in agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ ([Ca$^{2+}$]c) signals in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OP cells). We measured transmembrane potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane (delta psi m) and [Ca$^{2+}$]c in the immediate vicinity simultaneously using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) and calcium green respectively. Stimulation of OP cells with methacholine evoked robust [Ca$^{2+}$]c signals in approximately 80\% of cells which were either oscillatory or showed a peak followed by a plateau. Elevations in [Ca$^{2+}$]c induced by supramaximal concentrations of the agonist (> 200 microM) were accompanied by changes in delta psi m in 33-42\% of the total mitochondria investigated. The mitochondria that responded either depolarized (26-29\%), hyperpolarized (7-13\%) or showed no change (58-67\%). Thus, of the responsive mitochondria, most (70\%) depolarized during agonist-evoked [Ca$^{2+}$]c signals. Blockade of PTP with cyclosporin A (CSA) reduced the number of mitochondria that depolarized with a corresponding increase in the number that hyperpolarized. In addition, CSA or its analogue methyl valine-4- CSA (MeVal-CSA), reduced the frequency of agonist-evoked global [Ca$^{2+}$]c oscillations. In resting cells, CSA (63\%) and MeVal-CSA (77\%) hyperpolarized a majority of the mitochondria suggesting that PTP is constitutively active and may show flickering openings. Such hyperpolarizations were not mimicked by either cyclosporine H or verapamil and were inhibited by Ru360, which blocks the mitochondrial uniporter. This observation suggested that in resting cells, Ca$^{2+}$ ions might redistribute between cytosol and mitochondrial matrix through the uniporter and the PTP. Taken together, these data suggest that PTP may play an important role in regulating delta psi m and local [Ca$^{2+}$]c signals during agonist stimulation in OP cells.},

In the present study, we examined the frequency dependence of efonidipine action on the T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel in isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. The potency of efonidipine to inhibit the T-type Ca$^{2+}$ current was higher under higher stimulation frequencies. The IC50 values were 1.3 x 10(-8), 2.0 x 10(-6) and 6.3 x 10(-6) M under stimulation frequencies of 1, 0.2 and 0.05 Hz, respectively. The reduction of T-type Ca$^{2+}$ current amplitude was not accompanied by change in the time course of current decay. Efonidipine (10 microM) inhibited T-type Ca$^{2+}$ current elicited by depolarization from holding potentials ranging from -90 to -30 mV by about 30\%; the voltage-dependence of steady-state inactivation was not changed by the drug. Efonidipine slowed the recovery from inactivation following an inactivating prepulse. In conclusion, efonidipine was shown to have frequency-dependent inhibitory effects on the T-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel, which could be explained by slow dissociation of the drug from the inactivated state of the channel.},

abstract = {Mammalian eggs undergo a prolonged series of low frequency Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations at fertilization. These Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations are the immediate cause of egg activation. The Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in mouse eggs have been shown to be driven by increased InsP(3) production. Substantial evidence now indicates that a sperm-derived phospholipase C-zeta (PLC$\zeta$) is the key molecule that causes these Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations at fertilization. The fertilizing sperm is envisaged to introduce this essential molecule into the egg following gamete fusion. This review summarizes our current knowledge of how sperm PLC$\zeta$ causes these oscillations and why it is so much more effective at triggering InsP(3) production and Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in eggs, than other somatic isoforms of PLC. The molecular features of PLC$\zeta$ and how they relate to the pattern of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations seen at fertilization are considered. We also discuss the evidence that PLC$\zeta$ does not hydrolyze the conventional source of PI(4,5)P(2) in the plasma membrane to make InsP(3), but instead uses a distinct pool of PI(4,5)P(2) present on intracellular vesicles. This leads us to suggest that sperm PLC$\zeta$ may be targeted to these cytoplasmic vesicles by directly interacting with a specific but as yet unidentified egg PLC$\zeta$-binding protein.},

abstract = {The BH3-only protein BAD binds to Bcl-2 family proteins through its BH3 domain. Recent studies suggest that BAD binds to both Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), however mediates its pro-apoptotic functions through inhibition of Bcl-X(L), but not Bcl-2. In this paper we addressed this issue using a BAD mutant within the BH3 domain, by substitution of Asp 119 with Gly (BAD(D119G)), which selectively abrogates an ability to interact with Bcl-2. Confocal microscopy revealed that mutation of BAD at D119 does not affect BAD targeting to the mitochondrial membrane in serum-starved COS-7 cells. However, co-precipitation assays indicated that, whereas wild-type BAD (BADwt) directly interacts with Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), BAD(D119G) interacts only with Bcl-X(L). Nevertheless both BADwt and BAD(D119G) could introduce apoptosis and diminish the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) in a similar manner in a co-transfection assay. These data thus suggest that Asp119 is a crucial site within the BH3 domain of BAD for interaction of BAD with Bcl-2, but is dispensable for the interaction of BAD with Bcl-X(L), for its targeting to mitochondria, and most importantly, for its pro-apoptotic functions. Thus, we confirm that neutralization of Bcl-2 function is marginal for BAD-mediated apoptosis.},

abstract = {In human cells, Ero1-Lalpha and -Lbeta (hEROs) regulate oxidative protein folding by selectively oxidizing protein disulfide isomerase. Specific protein--protein interactions are probably crucial for regulating the formation, isomerization and reduction of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To identify molecules involved in ER redox control, we searched for proteins interacting with Ero1-Lalpha. Here, we characterize a novel ER resident protein (ERp44), which contains a thioredoxin domain with a CRFS motif and is induced during ER stress. ERp44 forms mixed disulfides with both hEROs and cargo folding intermediates. Whilst the interaction with transport-competent Ig-K chains is transient, ERp44 binds more stably with J chains, which are retained in the ER and eventually degraded by proteasomes. ERp44 does not bind a short-lived ribophorin mutant lacking cysteines. Its overexpression alters the equilibrium of the different Ero1-Lalpha redox isoforms, suggesting that ERp44 may be involved in the control of oxidative protein folding.},

Synaptotagmins are a family of type 1 membrane proteins that share a common domain structure. Most synaptotagmins are located in brain and endocrine cells, and some of these synaptotagmins bind to phospholipids and calcium at levels that trigger regulated exocytosis of SVs and LDCVs. This led to the proposed synaptotagmin-calcium-sensor paradigm, that is, members of the synaptotagmin family function as calcium sensors for the regulated exocytosis of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormones. Here, we provide an overview of the synaptotagmin family, and review the recent mouse genetic studies aimed at understanding the functions of synaptotagmins in neurotransmission and endocrine-hormone secretion.

abstract = {Oscillations in intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ can be induced by a variety of cellular signalling processes (Woods et al., 1986; Berridge 1988; Jacob et al., 1988) and appear to play a role in secretion (Stojilkovi\'{c} et al., 1994), fertilization (Miyazaki et al., 1993), and smooth muscle contraction (Iino and Tsukioka, 1994). Recently, great progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms involved in a particular class of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillation, associated with the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) (Berridge, 1993). Working in concert with intracellular Ca$^{2+}$, InsP3 controls Ca$^{2+}$ release via the InsP3 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Berridge and Irvine, 1989). The IP3 receptor is regulated by its coagonists InsP3 and Ca$^{2+}$, which both activate and inhibit Ca$^{2+}$ release (Finch et al., 1991; Bezprozvanny et al., 1991; De Young and Keizer, 1992). These processes, together with the periodic activation of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake into the ER, have been identified as key features in the mechanism of InsP3-induced Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in pituitary gonadotrophs (Li et al., 1994), Xenopus laevis oocytes (Lechleiter and Clapham, 1992; Atri et al., 1993), and other cell types (Keizer and De Young, 1993). Earlier discussions and models of InsP3-induced Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations focused on the nature and number of internal releasable pools of Ca$^{2+}$ (Goldbeter et al., 1990; Swillens and Mercan, 1990; Somogyi and Stucki, 1991), the importance of oscillations in InsP3 (Meyer and Stryer, 1988), and other issues not based on detailed experimental findings in specific cells types.},

@article{Glancy2012a,
abstract = {Calcium is an important signaling molecule involved in the regulation of many cellular functions. The large free energy in the Ca$^{2+}$ ion membrane gradients makes Ca$^{2+}$ signaling inherently sensitive to the available cellular free energy, primarily in the form of ATP. In addition, Ca$^{2+}$ regulates many cellular ATP-consuming reactions such as muscle contraction, exocytosis, biosynthesis, and neuronal signaling. Thus, Ca$^{2+}$ becomes a logical candidate as a signaling molecule for modulating ATP hydrolysis and synthesis during changes in numerous forms of cellular work. Mitochondria are the primary source of aerobic energy production in mammalian cells and also maintain a large Ca$^{2+}$ gradient across their inner membrane, providing a signaling potential for this molecule. The demonstrated link between cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations, identification of transport mechanisms, and the proximity of mitochondria to Ca$^{2+}$ release sites further supports the notion that Ca$^{2+}$ can be an important signaling molecule in the energy metabolism interplay of the cytosol with the mitochondria. Here we review sites within the mitochondria where Ca$^{2+}$ plays a role in the regulation of ATP generation and potentially contributes to the orchestration of cellular metabolic homeostasis. Early work on isolated enzymes pointed to several matrix dehydrogenases that are stimulated by Ca$^{2+}$, which were confirmed in the intact mitochondrion as well as cellular and in vivo systems. However, studies in these intact systems suggested a more expansive influence of Ca$^{2+}$ on mitochondrial energy conversion. Numerous noninvasive approaches monitoring NADH, mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption, and workloads suggest significant effects of Ca$^{2+}$ on other elements of NADH generation as well as downstream elements of oxidative phosphorylation, including the F(1)F(O)-ATPase and the cytochrome chain. These other potential elements of Ca$^{2+}$ modification of mitochondrial energy conversion will be the focus of this review. Though most specific molecular mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, it is clear that Ca$^{2+}$ provides a balanced activation of mitochondrial energy metabolism that exceeds the alteration of dehydrogenases alone.},

In cells that undergo activation or excitation, calcium is released from the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum to activate calcium-dependent kinases and phosphatases, thereby regulating numerous cellular processes; for example, apoptosis and autophagy. In the case of apoptosis, endogenous ligands or pharmacological agents induce prolonged cytosolic calcium elevation, which in turn leads to cell death. In contrast, there is now evidence that calcium regulates autophagy by several mechanisms, and these may be important for maintaining cell survival. Here we summarize what is known about how calcium regulates these life and death decisions. We pay particular attention to pathways that have been described in lymphocytes and cardiomyocytes, as these systems provide optimal models for understanding calcium signaling in the context of normal cell physiology.},

abstract = {Measuring variations of intracellular free calcium concentration through the changes in fluorescence of a calcium-sensitive dye is a ubiquitous technique in neuroscience. Despite its popularity, confidence intervals (CIs) on the estimated parameters of calcium dynamics models are seldom given. To address this issue, we have developed a two-stage model for ratiometric measurements obtained with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Its first element embeds a parametric calcium dynamics model into a fluorescence intensity model and its second element probabilistically describes the fluorescence measurements by a CCD camera. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we first show that the classical ratiometric transformation gives reliable CIs for time constants only and not baseline calcium concentration nor influx. We then introduce a direct method, which consists of fitting directly and simultaneously the fluorescence transients at both wavelengths, without any data ratioing. This approach uses a probabilistic description of the camera, leading to the construction of meaningful CIs for the calcium parameters. Moreover, using approaches inspired by constrained linear regression, we can take into account the finite precision on calibrated parameters (such as the dye dissociation constant in the cell). These key features are illustrated on simulated data using Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, we illustrate the strength of the direct method on experimental recordings from insect olfactory interneurons. In particular, we show how to handle a time-dependent buffer concentration, thereby considerably improving our goodness of fit. The direct method was implemented in the open-source software R and is freely distributed in the CalciOMatic package.},

abstract = {Calpains are Ca$^{2+}$ -dependent intracellular cysteine proteases that cleave a wide range of protein substrates to help implement calcium signaling in the cell. The major isoforms of this enzyme family, calpains-1 and -2, are heterodimers of a large and small subunit with the main dimer interface formed through their C-terminal penta-EF hand (PEF) domains. Calpain-3 or p94 is a skeletal muscle-specific isoform that is genetically linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Biophysical and modeling studies with the PEF domain of calpain-3 support the suggestion that the full-length calpain-3 exists as a homodimer. Here we report the crystallization of calpain-3's PEF domain and its crystal structure in the presence of Ca$^{2+}$ , which provides evidence for the homodimer architecture of calpain-3 and supports the molecular model that places a protease core at either end of the elongated dimer. Unlike other calpain PEF domain structures, the calpain-3 PEF domain contains a Ca$^{2+}$ bound at the EF5-hand used for homodimer association. Three of the four Ca$^{2+}$ -binding EF-hands of the PEF domains are concentrated near the protease core and have the potential to radically change the local charge within the dimer during calcium signaling. Examination of the homodimer interface shows that there would be steric clashes if the calpain-3 large subunit were to try to pair with a calpain small subunit.

A recent paper in Nature by Gavathiotis et al. provides the first biophysical evidence for a direct interaction between a BH3 domain, that of Bim, with Bax. Here, we review these intriguing observations and discuss their implications for our understanding of how the BH3-only proteins initiate apoptosis.},

abstract = {We present an integrated thermokinetic model describing control of cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics. The model describes the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling. The kinetic component of the model includes effectors of the TCA cycle enzymes regulating production of NADH and FADH(2), which in turn are used by the electron transport chain to establish a proton motive force (Delta mu(H)), driving the F(1)F(0)-ATPase. In addition, mitochondrial matrix Ca$^{2+}$, determined by Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter and Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger activities, regulates activity of the TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The model is described by twelve ordinary differential equations for the time rate of change of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)), and matrix concentrations of Ca$^{2+}$, NADH, ADP, and TCA cycle intermediates. The model is used to predict the response of mitochondria to changes in substrate delivery, metabolic inhibition, the rate of adenine nucleotide exchange, and Ca$^{2+}$. The model is able to reproduce, qualitatively and semiquantitatively, experimental data concerning mitochondrial bioenergetics, Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics, and respiratory control. Significant increases in oxygen consumption (V(O(2))), proton efflux, NADH, and ATP synthesis, in response to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$, are obtained when the Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive dehydrogenases are the main rate-controlling steps of respiratory flux. These responses diminished when control is shifted downstream (e.g., the respiratory chain or adenine nucleotide translocator). The time-dependent behavior of the model, under conditions simulating an increase in workload, closely reproduces experimentally observed mitochondrial NADH dynamics in heart trabeculae subjected to changes in pacing frequency. The steady-state and time-dependent behavior of the model support the hypothesis that mitochondrial matrix Ca$^{2+}$ plays an important role in matching energy supply with demand in cardiac myocytes.},

Using site-specific mutagenesis, we show here that the amino-acid residues critical for protection of cells by Bcl-XL against Sindbis virus-induced apoptosis are clustered within the Bcl-2-homology regions 1 and 2 (BH1 and BH2 regions). The residues necessary for Bcl-XL function are not identical to those required for Bcl-2 function. Although it has been suggested that heterodimerization between Bcl-XL and Bax is essential for the anti-death activity of Bcl-XL (refs 7,8), our results suggest that the interaction with Bax is not required for Bcl-XL to exert its death-repressing activity. Specific mutations that disrupt the ability of Bcl-XL to interact with Bax or Bak still preserve 70-80\% of the anti-death activity of wild-type Bcl-XL.},

abstract = {We study the models for calcium (Ca) dynamics developed in earlier studies, in each of which the key component is the kinetics of intracellular inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca channels. After rapidly equilibrating steps are eliminated, the channel kinetics in these models are represented by a single differential equation that is linear in the state of the channel. In the reduced kinetic model, the graph of the steady-state fraction of conducting channels as a function of log10(Ca) is a bell-shaped curve. Dynamically, a step increase in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate induces an incremental increase in the fraction of conducting channels, whereas a step increase in Ca can either potentiate or inhibit channel activation, depending on the Ca level before and after the increase. The relationships among these models are discussed, and experimental tests to distinguish between them are given. Under certain conditions the models for intracellular calcium dynamics are reduced to the singular perturbed form epsilon dx/d tau = f(x, y, p), dy/d tau = g(x, y, p). Phase-plane analysis is applied to a generic form of these simplified models to show how different types of Ca response, such as excitability, oscillations, and a sustained elevation of Ca, can arise. The generic model can also be used to study frequency encoding of hormonal stimuli, to determine the conditions for stable traveling Ca waves, and to understand the effect of channel properties on the wave speed.},

abstract = {Caspases are a large family of evolutionarily conserved proteases found from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. Although the first caspase was identified as a processing enzyme for interleukin-1beta, genetic and biochemical data have converged to reveal that many caspases are key mediators of apoptosis, the intrinsic cell suicide program essential for development and tissue homeostasis. Each caspase is a cysteine aspartase; it employs a nucleophilic cysteine in its active site to cleave aspartic acid peptide bonds within proteins. Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors termed procaspases; proteolytic processing of procaspase generates the tetrameric active caspase enzyme, composed of two repeating heterotypic subunits. Based on kinetic data, substrate specificity, and procaspase structure, caspases have been conceptually divided into initiators and effectors. Initiator caspases activate effector caspases in response to specific cell death signals, and effector caspases cleave various cellular proteins to trigger apoptosis. Adapter protein-mediated oligomerization of procaspases is now recognized as a universal mechanism of initiator caspase activation and underlies the control of both cell surface death receptor and mitochondrial cytochrome c-Apaf-1 apoptosis pathways. Caspase substrates have bene identified that induce each of the classic features of apoptosis, including membrane blebbing, cell body shrinkage, and DNA fragmentation. Mice deficient for caspase genes have highlighted tissue- and signal-specific pathways for apoptosis and demonstrated an independent function for caspase-1 and -11 in cytokine processing. Dysregulation of caspases features prominently in many human diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, and neurodegenerative disorders, and increasing evidence shows that altering caspase activity can confer therapeutic benefits.},

abstract = {Mechanoelectrical transducer currents in turtle auditory hair cells adapt to maintained stimuli via a Ca$^{2+}$-dependent mechanism that is sensitive to the level of internal calcium buffer. We have used the properties of transducer adaptation to compare the effects of exogenous calcium buffers in the patch electrode solution with those of the endogenous buffer assayed with perforated-patch recording. The endogenous buffer of the hair bundle was equivalent to 0.1-0.4 mM BAPTA and, in a majority of cells, supported adaptation in an external Ca$^{2+}$ concentration of 70 microM similar to that in turtle endolymph. The endogenous buffer had a higher effective concentration, and the adaptation time constant was faster in cells at the high-frequency end than at the low-frequency end of the cochlea. Experiments using buffers with different Ca$^{2+}$-binding rates or dissociation constants indicated that the speed of adaptation and the resting open probability of the transducer channels could be differentially regulated and imply that the endogenous buffer must be a fast, high-affinity buffer. In some hair cells, the transducer current did not decay exponentially during a sustained stimulus but displayed damped oscillations at a frequency (58-230 Hz) that depended on external Ca$^{2+}$ concentration. The gradient in adaptation time constant and the tuned transducer current at physiological levels of calcium buffer and external Ca$^{2+}$ suggest that transducer adaptation may contribute to hair cell frequency selectivity. The results are discussed in terms of feedback regulation of transducer channels mediated by Ca$^{2+}$ binding at two intracellular sites.},

abstract = {Although many cell functions are regulated by Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations induced by a cyclic release of Ca$^{2+}$ from intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ stores, the pacemaker mechanism of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations remains to be explained. Using green fluorescent protein-based Ca$^{2+}$ indicators that are targeted to intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ stores, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, we found that Ca$^{2+}$ shuttles between the ER and mitochondria in phase with Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. Following agonist stimulation, Ca$^{2+}$ release from the ER generated the first Ca$^{2+}$ oscillation and loaded mitochondria with Ca$^{2+}$. Before the second Ca$^{2+}$ oscillation, Ca$^{2+}$ release from the mitochondria by means of the Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger caused a gradual increase in cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration, inducing a regenerative ER Ca$^{2+}$ release, which generated the peak of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillation and partially reloaded the mitochondria. This sequence of events was repeated until mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ was depleted. Thus, Ca$^{2+}$ shuttling between the ER and mitochondria may have a pacemaker role in the generation of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of calcium homeostasis is presented in which the controlling factors are the plasma concentrations of calcium, PTH, and calcitriol, and the effector organs are the parathyroids, bone, kidney, and intestine. Other factors can be added as the need arises. The model is aimed at simulating what happens in a single individual, but its parameters and variables were adjusted to the corresponding published average values. Simulations of published observations in humans undergoing the infusion of calcium or its chelators are presented. With a single exception, these simulations provided a good fit to the data. The response of the system to extrinsic perturbations was characterized by simulating chronic infusions of calcium, PTH, and calcitriol. Finally, the steady state response to perturbations in some of its parameters (the secretory mass of the parathyroids and the affinity and/or sensitivity of the calcium, PTH, and calcitriol receptors) and to renal failure were also investigated in an attempt to analyze the pathogenesis of clinical hypo- or hypercalcemias. In its present form the model cannot be used to base clinical decisions in individual cases. However, it requires modest computational resources, and clinicians with a modest mathematical background can manipulate it. It is a useful tool for the analysis of general mechanisms of the diseases of calcium metabolism and for the design of clinical experiments aimed at characterizing these diseases. The model can also be the core of future autoadaptive extensions to be used in individual patients.},

abstract = {The Ca$^{2+}$ coupling between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria is central to multiple cell survival and cell death mechanisms. Cytoplasmic [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$](c)) spikes and oscillations produced by ER Ca$^{2+}$ release are effectively delivered to the mitochondria. Propagation of [Ca$^{2+}$](c) signals to the mitochondria requires the passage of Ca$^{2+}$ across three membranes, namely the ER membrane, the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Strategic positioning of the mitochondria by cytoskeletal transport and interorganellar tethers provides a means to promote the local transfer of Ca$^{2+}$ between the ER membrane and OMM. In this setting, even >100 microM [Ca$^{2+}$] may be attained to activate the low affinity mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. However, a mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] rise has also been documented during submicromolar [Ca$^{2+}$](c) elevations. Evidence has been emerging that Ca$^{2+}$ exerts allosteric control on the Ca$^{2+}$ transport sites at each membrane, providing mechanisms that may facilitate the Ca$^{2+}$ delivery to the mitochondria. Here we discuss the fundamental mechanisms of ER and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport, particularly the control of their activity by Ca$^{2+}$ and evaluate both high- and low-[Ca$^{2+}$]-activated mitochondrial calcium signals in the context of cell physiology.},

Mouse type I InsP3R (InsP3R1), found in high abundance in cerebellar Purkinje cells, is a polypeptide with three major functionally distinct regions: the amino-terminal InsP3-binding region, the central modulatory region and the carboxy-terminal channel region. Here we present a 2.2-A crystal structure of the InsP3-binding core of mouse InsP3R1 in complex with InsP3. The asymmetric, boomerang-like structure consists of an N-terminal beta-trefoil domain and a C-terminal alpha-helical domain containing an 'armadillo repeat'-like fold. The cleft formed by the two domains exposes a cluster of arginine and lysine residues that coordinate the three phosphoryl groups of InsP3. Putative Ca$^{2+}$-binding sites are identified in two separate locations within the InsP3-binding core.},

By incorporating different types of voltage-gated Ca$^{2+}$ channels and a previous model, this study reproduced typical Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in silico. Our model could mimic the oscillatory phenomenon under a wide range of experimental conditions, including resting membrane potential (-75 to -60 mV), extracellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration (0.1 to 1500 muM), temperature (20 to 37 degrees C), and blocking specific Ca$^{2+}$ channels. By varying the experimental conditions, the amplitude and duration of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations changed slightly (both <25\%), while the frequency changed significantly ( approximately 400\%). This indicates that spontaneous Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in astrocytes might be an all-or-none process, which might be frequency-encoded in signaling. Moreover, the properties of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations were found to be related to the dynamics of Ca$^{2+}$ influx, and not only to a constant influx. Therefore, calcium channels dynamics should be used in studying Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations. This work provides a platform to explore the still unclear mechanism of spontaneous Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in astrocytes.},

Ca$^{2+}$ sensors are thought to prevent spontaneous fusion at rest (clamping) and to promote fusion upon Ca$^{2+}$ activation. At least eight, often coexpressed, Ca$^{2+}$ sensors have been identified in mammals. Accumulating evidence suggests that multiple Ca$^{2+}$ sensors interact, rather than work autonomously, to produce the complex secretory response observed in neurons and secretory cells. In this review, we present several working models to describe how different sensors might be arranged to mediate synchronous, asynchronous and spontaneous neurotransmitter release. We discuss the scenario that different Ca$^{2+}$ sensors typically act on one shared vesicle pool and compete for binding the multiple SNARE complexes that are likely to assemble at single vesicles, to exert both clamping and fusion-promoting functions.},

Here we highlight that receptor tyrosine kinases rapidly translocate to the nucleus. Ca$^{2+}$ signals that are induced by growth factors result from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation within the nucleus rather than within the cytoplasm. This novel signaling mechanism may be responsible for growth factor effects on cell proliferation.},

abstract = {The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) is a tetrameric intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ channel, which mediates the release of Ca$^{2+}$ from the endoplasmic reticulum in response to many different extracellular stimuli. We present a 3D structure of the type 1 IP(3)R obtained by electron microscopy and single-particle analysis that reveals its domain organization. The IP(3)R has a flower-like appearance with fourfold symmetry and is made up of three distinct domains connected by slender links. By relating the organization of the structural domains to secondary-structure predictions and biochemical data we develop a model in which structural domains are mapped onto the amino acid sequence to deduce the location of the channel region and the cytoplasmic inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding and modulatory subdomains. The structure of the IP(3)R is compared with that of other tetrameric cation channels. The channel domain is similar in size and shape to its counterparts in the ryanodine receptor and the Shaker voltage-gated K(+) channel.},

abstract = {The newly emerging field of computational cell biology requires software tools that address the needs of a broad community of scientists. Cell biological processes are controlled by an interacting set of biochemical and electrophysiological events that are distributed within complex cellular structures. Computational modeling is familiar to researchers in fields such as molecular structure, neurobiology and metabolic pathway engineering, and is rapidly emerging in the area of gene expression. Although some of these established modeling approaches can be adapted to address problems of interest to cell biologists, relatively few software development efforts have been directed at the field as a whole. The Virtual Cell is a computational environment designed for cell biologists as well as for mathematical biologists and bioengineers. It serves to aid the construction of cell biological models and the generation of simulations from them. The system enables the formulation of both compartmental and spatial models, the latter with either idealized or experimentally derived geometries of one, two or three dimensions.},

@article{Cohen1997,
abstract = {Apoptosis is a major form of cell death, characterized initially by a series of stereotypic morphological changes. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the gene ced-3 encodes a protein required for developmental cell death. Since the recognition that CED-3 has sequence identity with the mammalian cysteine protease interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE), a family of at least 10 related cysteine proteases has been identified. These proteins are characterized by almost absolute specificity for aspartic acid in the P1 position. All the caspases (ICE-like proteases) contain a conserved QACXG (where X is R, Q or G) pentapeptide active-site motif. Capases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes comprising an N-terminal peptide (prodomain) together with one large and one small subunit. The crystal structures of both caspase-1 and caspase-3 show that the active enzyme is a heterotetramer, containing two small and two large subunits. Activation of caspases during apoptosis results in the cleavage of critical cellular substrates, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamins, so precipitating the dramatic morphological changes of apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by CD95 (Fas/APO-1) and tumour necrosis factor activates caspase-8 (MACH/FLICE/Mch5), which contains an N-terminus with FADD (Fas-associating protein with death domain)-like death effector domains, so providing a direct link between cell death receptors and the caspases. The importance of caspase prodomains in the regulation of apoptosis is further highlighted by the recognition of adapter molecules, such as RAIDD [receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-associated ICH-1/CED-3-homologous protein with a death domain]/CRADD (caspase and RIP adapter with death domain), which binds to the prodomain of caspase-2 and recruits it to the signalling complex. Cells undergoing apoptosis following triggering of death receptors execute the death programme by activating a hierarchy of caspases, with caspase-8 and possibly caspase-10 being at or near the apex of this apoptotic cascade.},

It participates not only in maintaining cellular homeostasis, but also in promoting survival during cellular stress situations. It is now well established that intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ is one of the regulators of autophagy. However, this control of autophagy by intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling is the subject of two opposite views. On the one hand, the available evidence indicates that intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals, and mainly inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs), suppress autophagy. On the other hand, elevated cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations ([Ca$^{2+}$](cyt)) were also shown to promote the autophagic process. Here, we will provide a critical overview of the literature and discuss both hypotheses. Moreover, we will suggest a model explaining how changes in intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signaling can lead to opposite outcomes, depending on the cellular state.},

Physical continuity of mitochondria was determined by three-dimensional reconstruction of fluorescence from mitochondrially targeted DsRed1 or calcein. The mitochondria of HeLa, PAEC, COS-7, HUVEC, hepatocytes, cortical astrocytes and neuronal cells all displayed heterogeneous distributions and were of varying sizes. There was a denser aggregation of mitochondria in perinuclear positions than in the cell periphery, where individual isolated mitochondria could be seen clearly. Using fluorescence-recovery after photobleaching, we observed that DsRed1 and calcein were highly mobile within the matrix of individual mitochondria, and that mitochondria within a cell were not lumenally continuous. Mitochondria were not electrically coupled, since only individual mitochondria were observed to depolarize following irradiation of TMRE-loaded cells. Functional heterogeneity of mitochondria in single cells was observed with respect to membrane potential, sequestration of hormonally evoked cytosolic calcium signals and timing of permeability transition pore opening in response to tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Our data indicate that mitochondria within individual cells are morphologically heterogeneous and unconnected, allowing them to have distinct functional properties.},

The channel subunit dynamics is a stochastic representation of the DeYoung-Keizer model. The calculations show that the concentration profile of fast buffer around an open channel is more localized than that of slow buffers. Slow buffers allow for release of larger amounts of Ca$^{2+}$ from the endoplasmic reticulum and hence bind more Ca$^{2+}$ than fast buffers with the same dissociation constant and concentration. I find oscillation-like behavior for high slow buffer concentration and low Ca$^{2+}$ content of the endoplasmic reticulum. High concentration of slow buffer leads to oscillation-like behavior by repetitive wave nucleation for high Ca$^{2+}$ content of the endoplasmic reticulum. Localization of Ca$^{2+}$ release by slow buffer, as used in experiments, can be reproduced by the modeling approach.},

abstract = {The adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), besides transferring ATP from the mitochondrial matrix to the rest of the cell, has also been proposed to be involved in mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and accordingly in mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis. In order to assess the role of ANT in Ca$^{2+}$ signal transmission from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria, we overexpressed the various ANT isoforms and measured the matrix [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) increases evoked by stimulation with IP3-dependent agonists. ANT overexpression reduced the amplitude of the [Ca$^{2+}$]m peak following Ca$^{2+}$ release, an effect that was markedly greater for ANT-1 and ANT-3 isoforms than for ANT-2. Three further observations might explain these findings. First, the effect was partially reversed by treating the cells with cyclosporine A, suggesting the involvement of MPT. Second, the effect was paralleled by alterations of the 3D structure of the mitochondria. Finally, ANT-1 and ANT-3 overexpression also caused a reduction of ER Ca$^{2+}$ loading that caused a marginal decrease in the cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ responses. Overall, these data provide evidence for the involvement of ANT-1 and ANT-3 in the induction of MPT and indicate the relevance of this phenomenon in ER-mitochondria Ca$^{2+}$ transfer.},

The frequency and amplitude of the oscillating signal can be varied infinitely by concerted actions of Ca$^{2+}$ transporters and Ca$^{2+}$-binding proteins to encode specific messages that trigger downstream molecular events. High frequency cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations regulate fast responses, such as synaptic transmission and secretion, whereas low frequency oscillations regulate slow processes, such as fertilization and gene transcription. Thus, the cell exploits Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations as a signalling carrier to transduce vital information that controls its behaviour.

abstract = {Quantal release, incremental detection, and oscillations are three types of Ca$^{2+}$ responses that can be obtained in different conditions, after stimulation of the intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ stores by submaximum concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3). All three phenomena are thought to occur through the regulatory properties of the InsP3 receptor/Ca$^{2+}$ channel. In the present study, we perform further analysis of the model (Swillens et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 91:10074-10078) previously proposed for transient InsP3-induced Ca$^{2+}$ release, based on the bell-shaped dependence of the InsP3 receptor activity on the Ca$^{2+}$ level and on the existence of an intermediate Ca$^{2+}$ domain located around the mouth of the channel. We show that Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations also arise in the latter model. Conditions for the occurrence of the various behaviors are investigated. Numerical simulations also show that the existence of an intermediate Ca$^{2+}$ domain can markedly increase the period of oscillations. Periods on the order of 1 min can indeed be accounted for by the model when one assigns realistic values to the kinetic constants of the InsP3 receptor, which, in the absence of a domain, lead to oscillations with periods of a few seconds. Finally, theoretical support in favor of a positive cooperativity in the regulation of the InsP3 receptor by Ca$^{2+}$ is presented.},

We report here that granule-associated calreticulin terminates with the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retrieval amino acid sequence and somehow escapes the KDEL retrieval system. In perforin knock-out mice calreticulin is still targeted into the granules. Thus, calreticulin will traffic without perforin to cytotoxic granules. In the granules, calreticulin and perforin are associated as documented by (i) copurification of calreticulin with perforin but not with granzymes and (ii) immunoprecipitation of a calreticulin-perforin complex using specific antibodies. By using calreticulin affinity chromatography and protein ligand blotting we show that perforin binds to calreticulin in the absence of Ca$^{2+}$ and the two proteins dissociate upon exposure to 0.1 mM or higher Ca$^{2+}$ concentration. Perforin interacts strongly with the P-domain of calreticulin (the domain which has high Ca$^{2+}$-binding affinity and chaperone function) as revealed by direct protein-protein interaction, ligand blotting, and the yeast two-hybrid techniques. Our results suggest that calreticulin may act as Ca$^{2+}$-regulated chaperone for perforin. This action will serve to protect the CTL during biogenesis of granules and may also serve to regulate perforin lytic action after release.},

abstract = {Increased resistance of airways or blood vessels within the lung is associated with asthma or pulmonary hypertension and results from contraction of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). To study the mechanisms regulating these contractions, we developed a mouse lung slice preparation containing bronchioles and arterioles and used phase-contrast and confocal microscopy to correlate the contractile responses with changes in [Ca$^{2+}$](i) of the SMCs. The airways are the focus of this study. The agonists, 5-hydroxytrypamine (5-HT) and acetylcholine (ACH) induced a concentration-dependent contraction of the airways. High concentrations of KCl induced twitching of the airway SMCs but had little effect on airway size. 5-HT and ACH induced asynchronous oscillations in [Ca$^{2+}$](i) that propagated as Ca$^{2+}$ waves within the airway SMCs. The frequency of the Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations was dependent on the agonist concentration and correlated with the extent of sustained airway contraction. In the absence of extracellular Ca$^{2+}$ or in the presence of Ni(2+), the frequency of the Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations declined and the airway relaxed. By contrast, KCl induced low frequency Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations that were associated with SMC twitching. Each KCl-induced Ca$^{2+}$ oscillation consisted of a large Ca$^{2+}$ wave that was preceded by multiple localized Ca$^{2+}$ transients. KCl-induced responses were resistant to neurotransmitter blockers but were abolished by Ni(2+) or nifedipine and the absence of extracellular Ca$^{2+}$. Caffeine abolished the contractile effects of 5-HT, ACH, and KCl. These results indicate that (a) 5-HT and ACH induce airway SMC contraction by initiating Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations, (b) KCl induces Ca$^{2+}$ transients and twitching by overloading and releasing Ca$^{2+}$ from intracellular stores, (c) a sustained, Ni(2+)-sensitive, influx of Ca$^{2+}$ mediates the refilling of stores to maintain Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations and, in turn, SMC contraction, and (d) the magnitude of sustained airway SMC contraction is regulated by the frequency of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations.},

Most attention will be focused on how second messengers and their downstream effectors are inactivated. The second messengers cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP are inactivated by phosphodiesterase (PDE) . Inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) metabolism is carried out by both inositol trisphosphatase and inositol phosphatases. Diacylglycerol (DAG) metabolism occurs through two enzyme systems, DAG kinase and DAG lipase. In the case of Ca$^{2+}$ signalling, recovery is carried out by the Ca$^{2+}$ pumps and exchangers that remove Ca$^{2+}$ from the cytoplasm. The mitochondria also play an important role in Ca$^{2+}$ homoeostasis. Many of these second messengers activate downstream effectors through protein phosphorylation, and these activation events are reversed by corresponding protein phosphatases .},

abstract = {Mitochondria play an important role in regulation of Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis in a cell. Here we present a mathematical model of mitochondrial ion transport and use this model to analyse different modes of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by mitochondria. The model includes transport of H+, Ca$^{2+}$, K$^+$, inorganic phosphate and oxidative substrates across the inner mitochondrial membrane harboring permeability transition pore (PTP). The detailed description of ion fluxes is based on the experimental ion kinetics in isolated mitochondria. Using the model we show that the kinetics of Ca$^{2+}$ uptake by mitochondria is regulated by the total amount of Ca$^{2+}$ in the system and the rate of Ca$^{2+}$ infusion. Varying these parameters we find three different modes of ion transport. When the total amount of Ca$^{2+}$ is below 140 nmol Ca$^{2+}$/mg protein, all available Ca$^{2+}$ is accumulated in the matrix without activation of the PTP. Between 140 and 160 nmol Ca$^{2+}$/mg protein, accumulation of Ca$^{2+}$ generates periodic opening and closure of the PTP and oscillations of ion fluxes. Higher levels of Ca$^{2+}$ (> 160 nmol Ca$^{2+}$/mg protein) result in a permanently open PTP, membrane depolarization and loss of small ions from the matrix. We show that in the intermediate range of Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations the rate of Ca$^{2+}$ infusion regulates the PTP state, so that slow Ca$^{2+}$ infusion does not lead to PTP opening, while fast Ca$^{2+}$ infusion results in an oscillatory state.},

Mitochondria from all studied tissues can accumulate and store Ca$^{2+}$ , but the maximum Ca$^{2+}$ storage capacity varies widely and exhibits striking tissue specificity. There is currently no explanation for this fact. Precipitation of Ca$^{2+}$ and phosphate in the mitochondrial matrix has been suggested to be the major form of storage of accumulated Ca$^{2+}$ in mitochondria. How this precipitate is formed is not known. The molecular identity of almost all proteins involved in Ca$^{2+}$ transport, storage and formation of the permeability transition pore is also unknown. This review summarizes studies aimed at identifying these proteins, and describes the properties of a known mitochondrial protein that may be involved in Ca$^{2+}$ transport and the structure of the permeability transition pore.},

abstract = {Mitochondria mediate dual metabolic and Ca$^{2+}$ shuttling activities. While the former is required for Ca$^{2+}$ signalling linked to insulin secretion, the role of the latter in $\beta$ cell function has not been well understood, primarily because the molecular identity of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transporters were elusive and the selectivity of their inhibitors was questionable. This study focuses on NCLX, the recently discovered mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger that is linked to Ca$^{2+}$ signalling in MIN6 and primary $\beta$ cells. Suppression either of NCLX expression, using a siRNA construct (siNCLX) or of its activity, by a dominant negative construct (dnNCLX), enhanced mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ influx and blocked efflux induced by glucose or by cell depolarization. In addition, NCLX regulated basal, but not glucose-dependent changes, in metabolic rate, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial resting Ca$^{2+}$. Importantly, NCLX controlled the rate and amplitude of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ changes induced by depolarization or high glucose, indicating that NCLX is a critical and rate limiting component in the cross talk between mitochondrial and plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$ signalling. Finally, knockdown of NCLX expression was followed by a delay in glucose-dependent insulin secretion. These findings suggest that the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger, NCLX, shapes glucose-dependent mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ signals thereby regulating the temporal pattern of insulin secretion in $\beta$ cells.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ (Ca$^{2+}$(m)) uptake is mediated by an inner membrane Ca$^{2+}$ channel called the uniporter. Ca$^{2+}$ uptake is driven by the considerable voltage present across the inner membrane ($\Delta$$\Psi$(m)) generated by proton pumping by the respiratory chain. Mitochondrial matrix Ca$^{2+}$ concentration is maintained five to six orders of magnitude lower than its equilibrium level, but the molecular mechanisms for how this is achieved are not clear. Here, we demonstrate that the mitochondrial protein MICU1 is required to preserve normal [Ca$^{2+}$](m) under basal conditions. In its absence, mitochondria become constitutively loaded with Ca$^{2+}$, triggering excessive reactive oxygen species generation and sensitivity to apoptotic stress. MICU1 interacts with the uniporter pore-forming subunit MCU and sets a Ca$^{2+}$ threshold for Ca$^{2+}$(m) uptake without affecting the kinetic properties of MCU-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. Thus, MICU1 is a gatekeeper of MCU-mediated Ca$^{2+}$(m) uptake that is essential to prevent [Ca$^{2+}$](m) overload and associated stress.},

abstract = {Calcium regulates numerous processes in the brain. How one signal can coordinate so many diverse actions, even within the same neurone, is the subject of intense investigation. Here we have used two-photon calcium imaging to determine the mechanism that enables calcium to selectively and appropriately induce different forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat hippocampus. Short-lasting LTP (LTP 1) required activation of ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which selectively increased calcium in synaptic spines. LTP of intermediate duration (LTP 2) was dependent on activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) and subsequent calcium release specifically in dendrites. Long-lasting LTP (LTP 3) was selectively dependent on L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCCs), which generated somatic calcium influx. Activation of NMDA receptors was necessary, but not sufficient, for the generation of appropriate calcium signals in spines and dendrites, and the induction of LTP 1 and LTP 2. These results suggest that the selective induction of different forms of LTP is achieved via spatial segregation of functionally distinct calcium signals.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Helicobacter pylori is an identified carcinogen for gastric cancer, however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be defined. In this review, we sought to elucidate the role of apoptosis in gastric carcinogenesis, to determine the influence of H. pylori infection on apoptosis, and finally to provide insights into the mechanisms by which H. pylori may lead to gastric carcinogenesis. METHODS: A broad-based MEDLINE and Current Contents literature search was performed to identify relevant publications between 1966 and March 2000 addressing H. pylori infection, apoptosis, cell proliferation, gastric carcinoma, oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes, as well as the products of these genes. Abstracts from recent major conferences that provided adequate additional data were also included. RESULTS: Apoptotic cells are rare in the glandular neck region (the generative cell zone) of normal gastric mucosa. With progression of atrophic gastritis, the generative cell zone shifts downward and a relatively large number of apoptotic cells occur. In intestinalized glands, both apoptotic cells and proliferative cells are present in deeper portions of the glands, corresponding to the generative zone. A higher frequency of apoptosis has been observed in gastric dysplasia than in coexisting gastric carcinomas, whereas the number of proliferative cells is significantly higher in gastric carcinoma than in dysplasia. Upregulation of oncogene bcl-2 in premalignant lesions and "downregulation" of the gene after malignant change is probably a common event. Accumulation of p53 protein is first detected in dysplasia, although mutation of the pS3 gene may occur in intestinal metaplasia. H. pylori infection induces apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells, which returns to normal after eradication of the infection. Numerous molecules produced by H. pylori including cytotoxin (VacA), lipopolysaccharide, monochloramine, and nitric oxide may directly induce apoptosis. Moreover, H. pylori-stimulated host inflammatory/immune responses lead to release of a large amount of cytokines. Cytokines produced by type 1 T helper cells, such as TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, markedly potentiate apoptosis. Gastric cell proliferation is significantly higher in patients with H. pylori infection than in normal controls, and eradication of the infection leads to a reduction in cell proliferation. Apoptosis and cell proliferation are also increased in precancerous lesions such as gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia in the presence of H. pylori infection. However, H. pylori-induced apoptosis may no longer be cell cycle-dependent in these lesions because of the occurrence of alterations and mutations of apoptosis-regulating genes, resulting in a loss of balance between apoptosis and cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: It is hypothesized that H. pylori-induced apoptosis may play a key role in gastric carcinogenesis by increasing cell proliferation and/or resulting in gastric atrophy.},

abstract = {Changes in cellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration control a wide range of physiological processes, from the subsecond release of synaptic neurotransmitters, to the regulation of gene expression over months or years. Ca$^{2+}$ can also trigger cell death through both apoptosis and necrosis, and so the regulation of cellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentration must be tightly controlled through the concerted action of pumps, channels and buffers that transport Ca$^{2+}$ into and out of the cell cytoplasm. A hallmark of cellular Ca$^{2+}$ signalling is its spatiotemporal complexity: stimulation of cells by a hormone or neurotransmitter leads to oscillations in cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration that can vary markedly in time course, amplitude, frequency, and spatial range. In this chapter we review some of the biological roles of Ca$^{2+}$, the experimental characterisation of complex dynamic changes in Ca$^{2+}$ concentration, and attempts to explain this complexity using computational models. We consider the 'toolkit' of cellular proteins which influence Ca$^{2+}$ concentrarion, describe mechanistic models of key elements of the toolkit, and fit these into the framework of whole cell models of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations and waves. Finally, we will touch on recent efforts to use stochastic modelling to elucidate elementary Ca$^{2+}$ signal events, and how these may evolve into global signals.},

In some cases, caspases also play a contributory role in escalating the propensity for apoptosis, and in doing so may exacerbate disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {In the preceding article [Am. J. Physiol. 274 (Cell Physiol. 43): C1158-C1173, 1998], we describe the development of a kinetic model for the interaction of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling and electrical activity in the pancreatic beta-cell. Here we describe further results of those simulations, focusing on mitochondrial variables, the rate of respiration, and fluxes of metabolic intermediates as a function of D-glucose concentration. Our simulations predict relatively smooth increases of O2 consumption, adenine nucleotide transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production by the tricarboxylic acid cycle as D-glucose concentrations are increased from basal to 20 mM. On the other hand, we find that the active fraction of pyruvate dehydrogenase saturates, due to increases in matrix Ca$^{2+}$, near the onset of bursting electrical activity and that the NADH/NAD+ ratio in the mitochondria increases by roughly an order of magnitude as glucose concentrations are increased. The mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio increases by factor of < 2 between the D-glucose threshold for bursting and continuous spiking. According to our simulations, relatively small changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (approximately 1 mV) caused by uptake of Ca$^{2+}$ are sufficient to alter the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio and influence ATP-sensitive K$^+$ channels in the plasma membrane. In the simulations, these cyclic changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential are due to synchronization of futile cycle of Ca$^{2+}$ from the cytoplasm through mitochondria via Ca$^{2+}$ uniporters and Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange. Our simulations predict steady mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations on the order of 0.1 microM at low glucose concentrations that become oscillatory with an amplitude on the order of 0.5 microM during bursting. Abrupt increases in mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentration > 5 microM may occur during continuous electrical activity.},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$ signaling is of vital importance to cardiac cell function and plays an important role in heart failure. It is based on sarcolemmal, sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ cycling. While the first two are well characterized, the latter remains unclear, controversial and technically challenging. In mammalian cardiac myocytes, Ca$^{2+}$ influx through L-type calcium channels in the sarcolemmal membrane triggers Ca$^{2+}$ release from the nearby junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum to produce Ca$^{2+}$ sparks. When this triggering is synchronized by the cardiac action potential, a global [Ca$^{2+}$](i) transient arises from coordinated Ca$^{2+}$ release events. The ends of intermyofibrillar mitochondria are located within 20 nm of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and thereby experience a high local [Ca$^{2+}$] during the Ca$^{2+}$ release process. Both local and global Ca$^{2+}$ signals may thus influence calcium signaling in mitochondria and, reciprocally, mitochondria may contribute to the local control of calcium signaling. In addition to the intermyofibrillar mitochondria, morphologically distinct mitochondria are also located in the perinuclear and subsarcolemmal regions of the cardiomyocyte and thus experience a different local [Ca$^{2+}$]. Here we review the literature in regard to several issues of broad interest: (1) the ultrastructural basis for mitochondrion - sarcoplasmic reticulum cross-signaling; (2) mechanisms of sarcoplasmic reticulum signaling; (3) mitochondrial calcium signaling; and (4) the possible interplay of calcium signaling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and adjacent mitochondria. Finally, this review discusses experimental findings and mathematical models of cardiac calcium signaling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, identifies weaknesses in these models, and suggests strategies and approaches for future investigations.},

abstract = {The S100 family of calcium binding proteins contains approximately 16 members each of which exhibits a unique pattern of tissue/cell type specific expression. Although the distribution of these proteins is not restricted to the nervous system, the implication of several members of this family in nervous system development, function, and disease has sparked new interest in these proteins. We now know that the original two members of this family, S100A1 and S100B, can regulate a diverse group of cellular functions including cell-cell communication, cell growth, cell structure, energy metabolism, contraction and intracellular signal transduction. Although some members of the family may function extracellularly, most appear to function as intracellular calcium-modulated proteins and couple extracellular stimuli to cellular responses via interaction with other cellular proteins called target proteins. Interaction of these proteins with target proteins appear to involve cysteine residues (one in S100A1 and two in S100B), as well as a stretch of 13 amino acids, in the middle of the molecule called the linker region, which connects the two EF-hand calcium binding domains. In addition to the amino acid sequence and secondary structures of these proteins, the structures of the genes encoding these proteins are highly conserved. Studies on the expression of these proteins have demonstrated that a complex mixture of transcriptional and postranscriptional mechanisms regulate S100 expression. Further analysis of the function and expression of these proteins in both nervous and nonnervous tissues will provide important information regarding the role of altered S100 expression in nervous system development, function and disease.},

The final crystallographic R-factor, based on 6685 reflections in the range 2.2 A less than or equal to d less than or equal to 5.0 A with intensities exceeding 2.5 sigma, is 0.175. Bond lengths and bond angles in the molecule have root-mean-square deviations from ideal values of 0.016 A and 1.7 degrees, respectively. The refined model includes residues 5 to 147, four Ca$^{2+}$ and 69 water molecules per molecule of calmodulin. The electron density for residues 1 to 4 and 148 is poorly defined, and they are not included in the model. The molecule is shaped somewhat like a dumbbell, with an overall length of 65 A; the two lobes are connected by a seven-turn alpha-helix. Prominent secondary structural features include seven alpha-helices, four Ca$^{2+}$-binding loops, and two short, double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheets between pairs of adjacent Ca$^{2+}$-binding loops. The four Ca$^{2+}$-binding domains in calmodulin have a typical EF hand conformation (helix-loop-helix) and are similar to those described in other Ca$^{2+}$-binding proteins. The X-ray structure determination of calmodulin shows a large hydrophobic cleft in each half of the molecule. These hydrophobic regions probably represent the sites of interaction with many of the pharmacological agents known to bind to calmodulin.},

abstract = {Usually, the occurrence of random cell behavior is appointed to small copy numbers of molecules involved in the stochastic process. Recently, we demonstrated for a variety of cell types that intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations are sequences of random spikes despite the involvement of many molecules in spike generation. This randomness arises from the stochastic state transitions of individual Ca$^{2+}$ release channels and does not average out due to the existence of steep concentration gradients. The system is hierarchical due to the structural levels channel--channel cluster--cell and a corresponding strength of coupling. Concentration gradients introduce microdomains which couple channels of a cluster strongly. But they couple clusters only weakly; too weak to establish deterministic behavior on cell level. Here, we present a multi-scale modelling concept for stochastic hierarchical systems. It simulates active molecules individually as Markov chains and their coupling by deterministic diffusion. Thus, we are able to follow the consequences of random single molecule state changes up to the signal on cell level. To demonstrate the potential of the method, we simulate a variety of experiments. Comparisons of simulated and experimental data of spontaneous oscillations in astrocytes emphasize the role of spatial concentration gradients in Ca$^{2+}$ signalling. Analysis of extensive simulations indicates that frequency encoding described by the relation between average and standard deviation of interspike intervals is surprisingly robust. This robustness is a property of the random spiking mechanism and not a result of control.},

abstract = {Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that modulate cellular Ca$^{2+}$ signals by interacting with Ca$^{2+}$ transporters on the plasma membrane or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To study how mitochondria dynamics affects cell Ca$^{2+}$ homeostasis, we overexpressed two mitochondrial fission proteins, hFis1 and Drp1, and measured Ca$^{2+}$ changes within the cytosol and the ER in HeLa cells. Both proteins fragmented mitochondria, decreased their total volume by 25-40\%, and reduced the fraction of subplasmalemmal mitochondria by 4-fold. The cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ signals elicited by histamine were unaltered in cells lacking subplasmalemmal mitochondria as long as Ca$^{2+}$ was present in the medium, but the signals were significantly blunted when Ca$^{2+}$ was removed. Upon Ca$^{2+}$ withdrawal, the free ER Ca$^{2+}$ concentration decreased rapidly, and hFis1 cells were unable to respond to repetitive histamine stimulations. The loss of stored Ca$^{2+}$ was due to an increased activity of plasma membrane Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase (PMCA) pumps and was associated with an increased influx of Ca$^{2+}$ and Mn2+ across store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ channels. The increased Ca$^{2+}$ influx compensated for the loss of stored Ca$^{2+}$, and brief Ca$^{2+}$ additions between successive agonist stimulations fully corrected subsequent histamine responses. We propose that the lack of subplasmalemmal mitochondria disrupts the transfer of Ca$^{2+}$ from plasma membrane channels to the ER and that the resulting increase in subplasmalemmal [Ca$^{2+}$] up-regulates the activity of PMCA. The increased Ca$^{2+}$ extrusion promotes ER depletion and the subsequent activation of store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ channels. Cells thus adapt to the lack of subplasmalemmal mitochondria by relying on external rather than on internal Ca$^{2+}$ for signaling.},

abstract = {Proteasome inhibitors induce rapid death of cancer cells. We show that in epithelial cancer cells, such death is associated with dramatic and simultaneous up-regulation of several BH3-only proteins, including BIK, BIM, MCL-1S, NOXA, and PUMA, as well as p53. Elevated levels of these proteins seem to be the result of direct inhibition of their proteasomal degradation, induction of transcription, and active translation. Subsequent cell death is independent of BAX, and probably BAK, and proceeds through the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. We identify the cascade of molecular events responsible for cell death induced by a prototypical proteasome inhibitor, MG132, starting with rapid accumulation of BH3-only proteins in the mitochondria, proceeding through mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and subsequent loss of DeltaPsi(m), and leading to irreversible changes of mitochondrial ultrastructure, degradation of mitochondrial network, and detrimental impairment of crucial mitochondrial functions. Our results also establish a rationale for the broader use of proteasome inhibitors to kill apoptosis-resistant tumor cells that lack functional BAX/BAK proteins.},

Analysis of single-channel recordings performed with different divalent cations present at 55 mM on the trans (intraluminal) side of the membrane revealed that the current amplitude at 0 mV and the single-channel slope conductance fell in the sequence: Ba (2.2 pA, 85 pS) > Sr (2.0 pA, 77 pS) > Ca (1.4 pA, 53 pS) > Mg (1.1 pA, 42 pS). The mean open time of the InsP3R recorded with Ca (2.9 ms) was significantly shorter than with other divalent cations (approximately 5.5 ms). The "anomalous mole fraction effect" was not observed in mixtures of divalent cations (Mg and Ba), suggesting that these channels are single-ion pores. Measurements of InsP3R activity at different intraluminal Ca levels demonstrated that Ca in the submillimolar range did not potentiate channel activity, and that very high levels of intraluminal Ca (> or = 10 mM) decreased channel open probability 5-10-fold. When InsP3R were measured with Ba as a current carrier in the presence of 110 mM cis potassium, a PBa/PK of 6.3 was estimated from the extrapolated value for the reversal potential. When the unitary current through the InsP3R at 0 mV was measured as a function of the permeant ion (Ba) concentration, the half-maximal current occurred at 10 mM trans Ba. The following conclusions are drawn from these data: (a) the conduction properties of InsP3R are similar to the properties of the ryanodine receptor, another intracellular Ca channel, and differ dramatically from the properties of voltage-gated Ca channels of the plasma membrane. (b) The estimated size of the Ca current through the InsP3R under physiological conditions is 0.5 pA, approximately four times less than the Ca current through the ryanodine receptor. (c) The potentiation of InsP3R by intraluminal Ca in the submillimolar range remains controversial. (d) A quantitative model that explains the inhibitory effects of high trans Ca on InsP3R activity was developed and the kinetic parameters of InsP3R gating were determined.},

abstract = {A controversy in the field of bioenergetics has been whether mitochondria are capable of sequestering enough Ca$^{2+}$ from cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ pulses to raise their intramitochondrial free Ca$^{2+}$ level ([Ca$^{2+}$]m). This is significant because an increase in [Ca$^{2+}$]m has been linked to an increase in cellular metabolic rate through various mechanisms. To resolve this question, we exposed isolated liver mitochondria to physiological type pulses of Ca$^{2+}$ produced using a pulse-generating system (Sparagna, G. C., Gunter, K. K., and Gunter, T. E. (1994) Anal. Biochem. 219, 96-103). We then measured the resulting mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. The uniporter was previously thought to be the only specific Ca$^{2+}$ uptake mechanism in mitochondria. Our studies have uncovered an additional uptake mechanism, the rapid mode of uptake or RaM, which functions at the beginning of each pulse and allows mitochondria to sequester a considerable amount of Ca$^{2+}$ from short pulses. We have shown that the RaM is reset by decreasing the [Ca$^{2+}$] between pulses for a very short time, making this uptake mode ideally suited for Ca$^{2+}$ sequestration from Ca$^{2+}$ pulse sequences. With rapid Ca$^{2+}$ uptake occurring at the beginning of each pulse, liver mitochondria may be able to sequester sufficient Ca$^{2+}$ from a short sequence of pulses to activate the cellular metabolic rate.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Many studies have evaluated the ways in which sleep disturbances may influence inflammation and the possible links of this effect to cardiovascular risk. Our objective was to investigate the effects of chronic sleep restriction and recovery on several blood cardiovascular biomarkers.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Nine healthy male non-smokers, aged 22-29 years, were admitted to the Sleep Laboratory for 11 days and nights under continuous electroencephalogram polysomnography. The study consisted of three baseline nights of 8 hours sleep (from 11 pm to 7 am), five sleep-restricted nights, during which sleep was allowed only between 1 am and 6 am, and three recovery nights of 8 hours sleep (11 pm to 7 am). Myeloperoxidase-modified low-density lipoprotein levels increased during the sleep-restricted period indicating an oxidative stress. A significant increase in the quantity of slow-wave sleep was measured during the first recovery night. After this first recovery night, insulin-like growth factor-1 levels increased and myeloperoxidase concentration peaked.

CONCLUSIONS: We observed for the first time that sleep restriction and the recovery process are associated with differential changes in blood biomarkers of cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {We present a bidomain fire-diffuse-fire model that facilitates mathematical analysis of propagating waves of elevated intracellular calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) in living cells. Modeling Ca$^{2+}$ release as a threshold process allows the explicit construction of traveling wave solutions to probe the dependence of Ca$^{2+}$ wave speed on physiologically important parameters such as the threshold for Ca$^{2+}$ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol, the rate of Ca$^{2+}$ resequestration from the cytosol to the ER, and the total [Ca$^{2+}$] (cytosolic plus ER). Interestingly, linear stability analysis of the bidomain fire-diffuse-fire model predicts the onset of dynamic wave instabilities leading to the emergence of Ca$^{2+}$ waves that propagate in a back-and-forth manner. Numerical simulations are used to confirm the presence of these so-called 'tango waves' and the dependence of Ca$^{2+}$ wave speed on the total [Ca$^{2+}$].},

abstract = {1. The free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration of mitochondria ([Ca$^{2+}$]m) in cultured rat brain astrocytes was measured with a fluorescent Ca$^{2+}$ indicator, rhod-2, and laser confocal microscopy. 2. Confocal images revealed a rhod-2 distribution that matched mitochondrial localization. 3. Using a Ca$^{2+}$ ionophore, ionomycin, to clamp the [Ca$^{2+}$]m from 0 to 100 microM in order to obtain the minimal and maximal fluorescence of rhod-2 in situ, a 3.5 +/- 0.4-fold increase in fluorescence intensity was observed, suggesting that the fluorescence of intramitochondrial rhod-2 was responding in a Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive manner, thereby allowing measurements of [Ca$^{2+}$]m in single astrocytes. 4. Exposure of fura-2-loaded astrocytes to 100 microM histamine produced a rapid and transient increase in cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]c) that lasted for several tens of seconds. The spike in [Ca$^{2+}$]c was frequently followed by variable numbers of repetitive oscillations of Ca$^{2+}$, which appeared to dampen in amplitude with time. 5. This pattern of histamine-induced [Ca$^{2+}$]c oscillations was also observed in rhod-2-loaded cells suggesting that [Ca$^{2+}$]m fluctuated with a similar frequency. 6. The oscillations of [Ca$^{2+}$]m, but not of [Ca$^{2+}$]c, were abolished by a proton ionophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP), and by Ruthenium Red, a mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$-uniporter inhibitor. 7. These results suggest that the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport systems in cultured rat brain astrocytes are able to relay receptor-mediated [Ca$^{2+}$]m oscillations into mitochondria.},

Unlike other major organs, the thymus is highly dynamic, capable of undergoing multiple rounds of almost complete atrophy followed by rapid restoration. The process of thymic atrophy, or involution, results in decreased thymopoiesis and emigration of na\"{\i}ve T cells to the periphery. Multiple processes can trigger transient thymic involution, including bacterial and viral infection(s), aging, pregnancy and stress. Intense investigations into the mechanisms that underlie thymic involution have revealed diverse cellular and molecular mediators, with elaborate control mechanisms. This review outlines the disparate pathways through which involution can be mediated, from the transient infection-mediated pathway, tightly controlled by microRNA, to the chronic changes that occur through aging.},

abstract = {Using confocal imaging of Rhod-2-loaded HeLa cells, we examined the ability of mitochondria to sequester Ca$^{2+}$ signals arising from different sources. Mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ (Ca$^{2+}$mit) uptake was stimulated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3))-evoked Ca$^{2+}$ release, capacitative Ca$^{2+}$ entry, and Ca$^{2+}$ leaking from the endoplasmic reticulum. For each Ca$^{2+}$ source, the relationship between cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ (Ca$^{2+}$cyt) concentration and Ca$^{2+}$mit was complex. With Ca$^{2+}$cyt < 300 nm, a slow and persistent Ca$^{2+}$mit uptake was observed. If Ca$^{2+}$cyt increased above approximately 400 nm, Ca$^{2+}$mit uptake accelerated sharply. For equivalent Ca$^{2+}$cyt increases, the rate of Ca$^{2+}$mit rise was greater with InsP(3)-evoked Ca$^{2+}$ signals than any other source. Spatial variation of the Ca$^{2+}$mit response was observed within individual cells. Both the fraction of responsive mitochondria and the amplitude of the Ca$^{2+}$mit response were graded in direct proportion to stimulus concentration. Trains of repetitive Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations did not maintain elevated Ca$^{2+}$mit levels. Only low frequency Ca$^{2+}$ transients (<1/15 min) evoked repetitive Ca$^{2+}$mit signals. Our data indicate that there is a lag between Ca$^{2+}$cyt and Ca$^{2+}$mit increases but that mitochondria will accumulate calcium when it is elevated over basal levels regardless of its source. Furthermore, in addition to the characteristics of Ca$^{2+}$ signals, Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter desensitization and proximity of mitochondria to InsP(3) receptors modulate mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ responses.},

abstract = {Ca$^{2+}$-release-activated Ca$^{2+}$ (CRAC) channels underlie sustained Ca$^{2+}$ signalling in lymphocytes and numerous other cells after Ca$^{2+}$ liberation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). RNA interference screening approaches identified two proteins, Stim and Orai, that together form the molecular basis for CRAC channel activity. Stim senses depletion of the ER Ca$^{2+}$ store and physically relays this information by translocating from the ER to junctions adjacent to the plasma membrane, and Orai embodies the pore of the plasma membrane calcium channel. A close interaction between Stim and Orai, identified by co-immunoprecipitation and by F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer, is involved in the opening of the Ca$^{2+}$ channel formed by Orai subunits. Most ion channels are multimers of pore-forming subunits surrounding a central channel, which are preassembled in the ER and transported in their final stoichiometry to the plasma membrane. Here we show, by biochemical analysis after cross-linking in cell lysates and intact cells and by using non-denaturing gel electrophoresis without cross-linking, that Orai is predominantly a dimer in the plasma membrane under resting conditions. Moreover, single-molecule imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Orai expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed predominantly two-step photobleaching, again consistent with a dimeric basal state. In contrast, co-expression of GFP-tagged Orai with the carboxy terminus of Stim as a cytosolic protein to activate the Orai channel without inducing Ca$^{2+}$ store depletion or clustering of Orai into punctae yielded mostly four-step photobleaching, consistent with a tetrameric stoichiometry of the active Orai channel. Interaction with the C terminus of Stim thus induces Orai dimers to dimerize, forming tetramers that constitute the Ca$^{2+}$-selective pore. This represents a new mechanism in which assembly and activation of the functional ion channel are mediated by the same triggering molecule.},

abstract = {Mitochondria not only govern energy production, but are also involved in crucial cellular signalling processes. They are one of the most important organelles determining the Ca$^{2+}$ regulatory pathway in the cell. Several mathematical models explaining these mechanisms were constructed, but only few of them describe interplay between calcium concentrations in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cytoplasm and mitochondria. Experiments measuring calcium concentrations in mitochondria and ER suggested the existence of cytosolic microdomains with locally elevated calcium concentration in the nearest vicinity of the outer mitochondrial membrane. These intermediate physical connections between ER and mitochondria are called MAM (mitochondria-associated ER membrane) complexes. We propose a model with a direct calcium flow from ER to mitochondria, which may be justified by the existence of MAMs, and perform detailed numerical analysis of the effect of this flow on the type and shape of calcium oscillations. The model is partially based on the Marhl et al model. We have numerically found that the stable oscillations exist for a considerable set of parameter values. However, for some parameter sets the oscillations disappear and the trajectories of the model tend to a steady state with very high calcium level in mitochondria. This can be interpreted as an early step in an apoptotic pathway.},

abstract = {MATCONT is a graphical MATLAB software package for the interactive numerical study of dynamical systems. It allows one to compute curves of equilibria, limit points, Hopf points, limit cycles, period doubling bifurcation points of limit cycles, and fold bifurcation points of limit cycles. All curves are computed by the same function that implements a prediction-correction continuation algorithm based on the Moore-Penrose matrix pseudo-inverse. The continuation of bifurcation points of equilibria and limit cycles is based on bordering methods and minimally extended systems. Hence no additional unknowns such as singular vectors and eigenvectors are used and no artificial sparsity in the systems is created. The sparsity of the discretized systems for the computation of limit cycles and their bifurcation points is exploited by using the standard Matlab sparse matrix methods. The MATLAB environment makes the standard MATLAB Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) Suite interactively available and provides computational and visualization tools; it also eliminates the compilation stage and so makes installation straightforward. Compared to other packages such as AUTO and CONTENT, adding a new type of curves is easy in the MATLAB environment. We illustrate this by a detailed description of the limit point curve type.},

abstract = {Activation of nuclear transcription factors, breakdown of nuclear envelope and apoptosis represent a group of nuclear events thought to be modulated by changes in nucleoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration, [Ca$^{2+}$]n. Direct evidence for, or against, this possibility has been, however, difficult to obtain because measurements of [Ca$^{2+}$]n are hampered by major technical problems. Here we describe a new approach for selectively monitoring Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations inside the nucleus of living cells, which is based on the construction of a chimeric cDNA encoding a fusion protein composed of the photoprotein aequorin and a nuclear translocation signal derived from the rat glucocorticoid receptor. This modified aequorin (nuAEQ), stably expressed in HeLa cells, was largely confined to the nucleoplasm and thus utilized for monitoring [Ca$^{2+}$]n in intact cells. No significant differences were observed between [Ca$^{2+}$]n and cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$]i) under resting conditions. Upon stimulation of surface receptors linked to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) generation, and thus to intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ signalling, the kinetics of [Ca$^{2+}$]i and [Ca$^{2+}$]n increases were indistinguishable. However, for the same rise in [Ca$^{2+}$]i, the amplitude of [Ca$^{2+}$]n increase was larger when evoked by Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization from internal stores than when induced by Ca$^{2+}$ influx across the plasma membrane. The functional significance of these transient nucleus-cytosol Ca$^{2+}$ gradients is discussed.},

abstract = {Calcium ions are ubiquitous and versatile signaling molecules, capable of decoding a variety of extracellular stimuli (hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, etc.) into markedly different intracellular actions, ranging from contraction to secretion, from proliferation to cell death. The key to this pleiotropic role is the complex spatiotemporal organization of the [Ca$^{2+}$] rise evoked by extracellular agonists, which allows selected effectors to be recruited and specific actions to be initiated. In this review, we discuss the structural and functional bases that generate the subcellular heterogeneity in cellular Ca$^{2+}$ levels at rest and under stimulation. This complex choreography requires the concerted action of many different players; the central role is, of course, that of the calcium ion, with the main supporting characters being all the entities responsible for moving Ca$^{2+}$ between different compartments, while the cellular architecture provides a determining framework within which all the players have their exits and their entrances. In particular, we concentrate on the molecular mechanisms that lead to the generation of cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ microdomains, focusing on their different subcellular location, mechanism of generation, and functional role.},

abstract = {Fertilization of mammalian eggs is characterized by a series of Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations triggered by a phospholipase C activity. These Ca$^{2+}$ increases and the parallel generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) stimulate protein kinase C (PKC). However, the dynamics of PKC activity have not been directly measured in living eggs. Here, we have monitored the dynamics of PKC-induced phosphorylation in mouse eggs, alongside Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations, using fluorescent C-kinase activity reporter (CKAR) probes. Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations triggered either by sperm, phospholipase C zeta (PLC$\zeta$) or Sr(2+) all caused repetitive increases in PKC-induced phosphorylation, as detected by CKAR in the cytoplasm or plasma membrane. The CKAR responses lasted for several minutes in both the cytoplasm and plasma membrane then returned to baseline values before subsequent Ca$^{2+}$ transients. High frequency oscillations caused by PLC$\zeta$ led to an integration of PKC-induced phosphorylation. The conventional PKC inhibitor, G\"{o}6976, could inhibit CKAR increases in response to thapsigargin or ionomycin, but not the repetitive responses seen at fertilization. Repetitive increases in PKC$\delta$ activity were also detected during Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations using an isoform-specific $\delta$CKAR. However, PKC$\delta$ may already be mostly active in unfertilized eggs, since phorbol esters were effective at stimulating $\delta$CKAR only after fertilization, and the PKC$\delta$-specific inhibitor, rottlerin, decreased the CKAR signals in unfertilized eggs. These data show that PKC-induced phosphorylation outlasts each Ca$^{2+}$ increase in mouse eggs but that signal integration only occurs at a non-physiological, high Ca$^{2+}$ oscillation frequency. The results also suggest that Ca$^{2+}$ -induced DAG formation on intracellular membranes may stimulate PKC activity oscillations at fertilization.},

abstract = {The Ca$^{2+}$ coupling between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria is central to multiple cell survival and cell death mechanisms. Cytoplasmic [Ca$^{2+}$] ([Ca$^{2+}$](c)) spikes and oscillations produced by ER Ca$^{2+}$ release are effectively delivered to the mitochondria. Propagation of [Ca$^{2+}$](c) signals to the mitochondria requires the passage of Ca$^{2+}$ across three membranes, namely the ER membrane, the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Strategic positioning of the mitochondria by cytoskeletal transport and interorganellar tethers provides a means to promote the local transfer of Ca$^{2+}$ between the ER membrane and OMM. In this setting, even >100 microM [Ca$^{2+}$] may be attained to activate the low affinity mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake. However, a mitochondrial [Ca$^{2+}$] rise has also been documented during submicromolar [Ca$^{2+}$](c) elevations. Evidence has been emerging that Ca$^{2+}$ exerts allosteric control on the Ca$^{2+}$ transport sites at each membrane, providing mechanisms that may facilitate the Ca$^{2+}$ delivery to the mitochondria. Here we discuss the fundamental mechanisms of ER and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport, particularly the control of their activity by Ca$^{2+}$ and evaluate both high- and low-[Ca$^{2+}$]-activated mitochondrial calcium signals in the context of cell physiology.},

abstract = {African trypanosomes of the Trypanosoma brucei species are extracellular protozoan parasites that cause the deadly disease African trypanosomiasis in humans and contribute to the animal counterpart, Nagana. Trypanosome clearance from the bloodstream is mediated by antibodies specific for their Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) coat antigens. However, T. brucei infection induces polyclonal B cell activation, B cell clonal exhaustion, sustained depletion of mature splenic Marginal Zone B (MZB) and Follicular B (FoB) cells, and destruction of the B-cell memory compartment. To determine how trypanosome infection compromises the humoral immune defense system we used a C57BL/6 T. brucei AnTat 1.1 mouse model and multicolor flow cytometry to document B cell development and maturation during infection. Our results show a more than 95\% reduction in B cell precursor numbers from the CLP, pre-pro-B, pro-B, pre-B and immature B cell stages in the bone marrow. In the spleen, T. brucei induces extramedullary B lymphopoiesis as evidenced by significant increases in HSC-LMPP, CLP, pre-pro-B, pro-B and pre-B cell populations. However, final B cell maturation is abrogated by infection-induced apoptosis of transitional B cells of both the T1 and T2 populations which is not uniquely dependent on TNF-, Fas-, or prostaglandin-dependent death pathways. Results obtained from ex vivo co-cultures of living bloodstream form trypanosomes and splenocytes demonstrate that trypanosome surface coat-dependent contact with T1/2 B cells triggers their deletion. We conclude that infection-induced and possibly parasite-contact dependent deletion of transitional B cells prevents replenishment of mature B cell compartments during infection thus contributing to a loss of the host's capacity to sustain antibody responses against recurring parasitemic waves.},

abstract = {The amount of Ca$^{2+}$ taken up in the mitochondrial matrix is a crucial determinant of cell fate; it plays a decisive role in the choice of the cell between life and death. The Ca$^{2+}$ ions mainly originate from the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-sensitive Ca$^{2+}$ stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The uptake of these Ca$^{2+}$ ions in the mitochondria depends on the functional properties and the subcellular localization of the IP(3) receptor (IP(3)R) in discrete domains near the mitochondria. To allow for an efficient transfer of the Ca$^{2+}$ ions from the ER to the mitochondria, structural interactions between IP(3)Rs and mitochondria are needed. This review will focus on the key proteins involved in these interactions, how they are regulated, and what are their physiological roles in apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy.

Their regulation by Ca$^{2+}$ allows them also to propagate cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ signals regeneratively. This brief review addresses the structural basis of IP(3)R activation by IP(3) and Ca$^{2+}$. IP(3) initiates IP(3)R activation by promoting Ca$^{2+}$ binding to a stimulatory Ca$^{2+}$-binding site, the identity of which is unresolved. We suggest that interactions of critical phosphate groups in IP(3) with opposite sides of the clam-like IP(3)-binding core cause it to close and propagate a conformational change toward the pore via the adjacent N-terminal suppressor domain. The pore, assembled from the last pair of transmembrane domains and the intervening pore loop from each of the four IP(3)R subunits, forms a structure in which a luminal selectivity filter and a gate at the cytosolic end of the pore control cation fluxes through the IP(3)R.},

The SER can also be functionally segregated into domains that regulate ER-Golgi traffic (transitional ER), ERAD (ER-associated degradation), sterol and lipid biosynthesis and calcium sequestration. The last two, as well as apoptosis, are critically regulated by the close association of the SER with mitochondria. Studies with AMFR (autocrine motility factor receptor) have defined an SER domain whose integrity and mitochondrial association can be modulated by ilimaquinone as well as by free cytosolic calcium levels in the normal physiological range. AMFR is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets its ligand directly to the SER via a caveolae/raft-dependent pathway. In the present review, we will address the relationship between the calcium-dependent morphology and mitochondrial association of the SER and its various functional roles in the cell.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that ruthenium red (RuR) binds to the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in the outer mitochondrial membrane, decreasing channel conductance and protecting against apoptotic cell death. In this report, we define the murine and yeast VDAC1 amino acid residues involved in the interaction with RuR. Binding of RuR to bilayer-reconstituted mVDAC1 and the resulting channel closure was inhibited upon mutation of specific VDAC1 residues. RuR protection against cell death, as induced by overexpression of native or mutated mVDAC1, was also diminished upon mutation of these amino acids. Moreover, RuR-mediated inhibition of cytochrome c release normally induced by staurosporine was not observed in cells expressing mutants VDAC1. We found that four glutamate residues, two each located in the first and third mVDAC1 cytosolic loops, are required for the interaction of VDAC1 with RuR and subsequent protection against cell death. Similar results were obtained with Q72E-yeast VDAC1, except that only three glutamate residues, located in two cytosolic loops were required. As a hexavalent reagent, RuR is expected to bind to more than one negatively charged group. Our results thus clearly indicate that RuR protects against cell death via a direct interaction with VDAC1 to inhibit cytochrome c release and subsequent cell death.},

In the present study, we used immunoprecipitation to investigate the interactions of P-SG/calreticulin with other proteins during cellular recovery from heat stress. In heat-stressed CHO and M21 cells, both glycosylated and unglycosylated P-SGs interact with HSP90, GRP94, GRP78, and the other prompt stress glycoprotein, P-SG50, in an ATP-independent manner. Specificity of HSP-P-SG interactions was determined by chemical cross-linking with the homo-bifunctional agent DSP (3,3'-dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate]). Characterization of the cross-linked complexes involving calreticulin and heat shock proteins (HSPs) showed an average mass of 400-600 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. Overall, the consistent association of glycosylated and unglycosylated calreticulin with P-SG50 and unglycosylated HSPs suggests that P-SG/calreticulin is an active member of the cast of glycone/aglycone chaperones that cooperate to achieve cellular recovery from acute heat stress.},

abstract = {Smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction is controlled by the Ca$^{2+}$ and Rho kinase signalling pathways. While the SMC Rho kinase system seems to be reasonably constant, there is enormous variation with regard to the mechanisms responsible for generating Ca$^{2+}$ signals. One way of dealing with this diversity is to consider how this system has been adapted to control different SMC functions. Phasic SMCs (vas deferens, uterus and bladder) rely on membrane depolarization to drive Ca$^{2+}$ influx across the plasma membrane. This depolarization can be induced by neurotransmitters or through the operation of a membrane oscillator. Many tonic SMCs (vascular, airway and corpus cavernosum) are driven by a cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ oscillator that generates periodic pulses of Ca$^{2+}$. A similar oscillator is present in pacemaker cells such as the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and atypical SMCs that control other tonic SMCs (gastrointestinal, urethra, ureter). The changes in membrane potential induced by these cytosolic oscillators does not drive contraction directly but it functions to couple together individual oscillators to provide the synchronization that is a characteristic feature of many tonic SMCs.},

abstract = {We report here the identification of a novel protein, Smac, which promotes caspase activation in the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 pathway. Smac promotes caspase-9 activation by binding to inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, IAPs, and removing their inhibitory activity. Smac is normally a mitochondrial protein but is released into the cytosol when cells undergo apoptosis. Mitochondrial import and cleavage of its signal peptide are required for Smac to gain its apoptotic activity. Overexpression of Smac increases cells' sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Smac is the second mitochondrial protein, along with cytochrome c, that promotes apoptosis by activating caspases.},

In analogy with the Ca$^{2+}$-ligated state of this protein, it consists of two small globular domains separated by a flexible linker, with no stable, direct contacts between the two domains. In the absence of Ca$^{2+}$, the four helices in each of the two globular domains form a highly twisted bundle, capped by a short anti-parallel beta-sheet. This arrangement is qualitatively similar to that observed in the crystal structure of the Ca$^{2+}$-free N-terminal domain of troponin C.},

abstract = {Sirtuins have emerged as important proteins in aging, stress resistance and metabolic regulation. Three sirtuins, SIRT3, 4 and 5, are located within the mitochondrial matrix. SIRT3 and SIRT5 are NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases that remove acetyl groups from acetyllysine-modified proteins and yield 2'-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. SIRT4 can transfer the ADP-ribose group from NAD(+) onto acceptor proteins. Recent findings reveal that a large fraction of mitochondrial proteins are acetylated and that mitochondrial protein acetylation is modulated by nutritional status. This and the identification of targets for SIRT3, 4 and 5 support the model that mitochondrial sirtuins are metabolic sensors that modulate the activity of metabolic enzymes via protein deacetylation or mono-ADP-ribosylation. Here, we review and discuss recent progress in the study of mitochondrial sirtuins and their targets.},

abstract = {Among the many unsolved problems of calcium signalling, the role of calcium elevations in apoptotic and necrotic cell death has been a focus of research in recent years. Evidence has been presented that calcium oscillations can effectively trigger apoptosis under certain conditions and that dysregulation of calcium signalling is a common cause of cell death. These effects are regularly mediated through calcium signal propagation to the mitochondria and the ensuing mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria to the cytoplasm. The progress in this area depended on the development of (1) fluorescent/luminescent probes, including fluorescent proteins that can be genetically targeted to different intracellular locations and (2) the digital imaging technology, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and fluorescent high throughput approaches, which allowed dynamic measurements of both [Ca$^{2+}$] in the intracellular compartments of interest and the downstream processes. Fluorescence single cell imaging has been the only possible approach to resolve the cell-to-cell heterogeneity and the complex subcellular spatiotemporal organization of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium signals and downstream events. We outline here fluorometric and fluorescence imaging protocols that we set up for the study of calcium in the context of apoptosis.},

abstract = {To quantify how various molecular mechanisms are integrated to maintain platelet homeostasis and allow responsiveness to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), we developed a computational model of the human platelet. Existing kinetic information for 77 reactions, 132 fixed kinetic rate constants, and 70 species was combined with electrochemical calculations, measurements of platelet ultrastructure, novel experimental results, and published single-cell data. The model accurately predicted: (1) steady-state resting concentrations for intracellular calcium, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; (2) transient increases in intracellular calcium, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and G(q)-GTP in response to ADP; and (3) the volume of the platelet dense tubular system. A more stringent test of the model involved stochastic simulation of individual platelets, which display an asynchronous calcium spiking behavior in response to ADP. Simulations accurately reproduced the broad frequency distribution of measured spiking events and demonstrated that asynchronous spiking was a consequence of stochastic fluctuations resulting from the small volume of the platelet. The model also provided insights into possible mechanisms of negative-feedback signaling, the relative potency of platelet agonists, and cell-to-cell variation across platelet populations. This integrative approach to platelet biology offers a novel and complementary strategy to traditional reductionist methods.},

abstract = {GRP78 is a major protein regulated by the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and up-regulation has been shown to be important in protecting cells from challenge with cytotoxic agents. GRP78 has ATPase activity, acts as a chaperone, and interacts specifically with other proteins, such as caspases, as part of a mechanism regulating apoptosis. GRP78 is also reported to have a possible role as a Ca$^{2+}$ storage protein. In order to understand the potential biological effects of Ca$^{2+}$ and ATP/ADP binding on the biology of GRP78, we have determined its ligand binding properties. We show here for the first time that GRP78 can bind Ca$^{2+}$, ATP, and ADP, each with a 1:1 stoichiometry, and that the binding of cation and nucleotide is cooperative. These observations do not support the hypothesis that GRP78 is a dynamic Ca$^{2+}$ storage protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that whereas Mg2+ enhances GRP78 binding to ADP and ATP to the same extent, Ca$^{2+}$ shows a differential enhancement. In the presence of Ca$^{2+}$, the KD for ATP is lowered approximately 11-fold, and the KD for ADP is lowered around 930-fold. The KD for Ca$^{2+}$ is lowered approximately 40-fold in the presence of ATP and around 880-fold with ADP. These findings may explain the biological requirement for a nucleotide exchange factor to remove ADP from GRP78. Taken together, our data suggest that the Ca$^{2+}$-binding property of GRP78 may be part of a signal transduction pathway that modulates complex interactions between GRP78, ATP/ADP, secretory proteins, and caspases, and this ultimately has important consequences for cell viability.},

abstract = {Synaptotagmin is the major calcium sensor for fast synaptic transmission that requires the synchronous fusion of synaptic vesicles. Synaptotagmin contains two calcium-binding domains: C2A and C2B. Mutation of a positively charged residue (R233Q in rat) showed that Ca$^{2+}$-dependent interactions between the C2A domain and membranes play a role in the electrostatic switch that initiates fusion. Surprisingly, aspartate-to-asparagine mutations in C2A that inhibit Ca$^{2+}$ binding support efficient synaptic transmission, suggesting that Ca$^{2+}$ binding by C2A is not required for triggering synchronous fusion. Based on a structural analysis, we generated a novel mutation of a single Ca$^{2+}$-binding residue in C2A (D229E in Drosophila) that inhibited Ca$^{2+}$ binding but maintained the negative charge of the pocket. This C2A aspartate-to-glutamate mutation resulted in ∼80\% decrease in synchronous transmitter release and a decrease in the apparent Ca$^{2+}$ affinity of release. Previous aspartate-to-asparagine mutations in C2A partially mimicked Ca$^{2+}$ binding by decreasing the negative charge of the pocket. We now show that the major function of Ca$^{2+}$ binding to C2A is to neutralize the negative charge of the pocket, thereby unleashing the fusion-stimulating activity of synaptotagmin. Our results demonstrate that Ca$^{2+}$ binding by C2A is a critical component of the electrostatic switch that triggers synchronous fusion. Thus, Ca$^{2+}$ binding by C2B is necessary and sufficient to regulate the precise timing required for coupling vesicle fusion to Ca$^{2+}$ influx, but Ca$^{2+}$ binding by both C2 domains is required to flip the electrostatic switch that triggers efficient synchronous synaptic transmission.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial calcium accumulation was recently shown to depend on a complex composed of an inner-membrane channel (MCU and MCUb) and regulatory subunits (MICU1, MCUR1, and EMRE). A fundamental property of MCU is low activity at resting cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations, preventing deleterious Ca$^{2+}$ cycling and organelle overload. Here we demonstrate that these properties are ensured by a regulatory heterodimer composed of two proteins with opposite effects, MICU1 and MICU2, which, both in purified lipid bilayers and in intact cells, stimulate and inhibit MCU activity, respectively. Both MICU1 and MICU2 are regulated by calcium through their EF-hand domains, thus accounting for the sigmoidal response of MCU to [Ca$^{2+}$] in situ and allowing tight physiological control. At low [Ca$^{2+}$], the dominant effect of MICU2 largely shuts down MCU activity; at higher [Ca$^{2+}$], the stimulatory effect of MICU1 allows the prompt response of mitochondria to Ca$^{2+}$ signals generated in the cytoplasm.},

Physiol. 274 (Cell Physiol. 43): C1158-C1173, 1998], we describe the development of a kinetic model for the interaction of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ handling and electrical activity in the pancreatic beta-cell. Here we describe further results of those simulations, focusing on mitochondrial variables, the rate of respiration, and fluxes of metabolic intermediates as a function of D-glucose concentration. Our simulations predict relatively smooth increases of O2 consumption, adenine nucleotide transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production by the tricarboxylic acid cycle as D-glucose concentrations are increased from basal to 20 mM. On the other hand, we find that the active fraction of pyruvate dehydrogenase saturates, due to increases in matrix Ca$^{2+}$, near the onset of bursting electrical activity and that the NADH/NAD+ ratio in the mitochondria increases by roughly an order of magnitude as glucose concentrations are increased. The mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio increases by factor of < 2 between the D-glucose threshold for bursting and continuous spiking. According to our simulations, relatively small changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (approximately 1 mV) caused by uptake of Ca$^{2+}$ are sufficient to alter the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio and influence ATP-sensitive K$^+$ channels in the plasma membrane. In the simulations, these cyclic changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential are due to synchronization of futile cycle of Ca$^{2+}$ from the cytoplasm through mitochondria via Ca$^{2+}$ uniporters and Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchange. Our simulations predict steady mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations on the order of 0.1 microM at low glucose concentrations that become oscillatory with an amplitude on the order of 0.5 microM during bursting. Abrupt increases in mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentration > 5 microM may occur during continuous electrical activity.},

abstract = {The ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a family of Ca$^{2+}$ release channels found on intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ storage/release organelles. The RyR channels are ubiquitously expressed in many types of cells and participate in a variety of important Ca$^{2+}$ signaling phenomena (neurotransmission, secretion, etc.). In striated muscle, the RyR channels represent the primary pathway for Ca$^{2+}$ release during the excitation-contraction coupling process. In general, the signals that activate the RyR channels are known (e.g., sarcolemmal Ca$^{2+}$ influx or depolarization), but the specific mechanisms involved are still being debated. The signals that modulate and/or turn off the RyR channels remain ambiguous and the mechanisms involved unclear. Over the last decade, studies of RyR-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release have taken many forms and have steadily advanced our knowledge. This robust field, however, is not without controversial ideas and contradictory results. Controversies surrounding the complex Ca$^{2+}$ regulation of single RyR channels receive particular attention here. In addition, a large body of information is synthesized into a focused perspective of single RyR channel function. The present status of the single RyR channel field and its likely future directions are also discussed.},

abstract = {Intracellular calcium oscillations, which are oscillatory changes of cytosolic calcium concentration in response to agonist stimulation, are experimentally well observed in various living cells. Simple calcium oscillations represent the most common pattern and many mathematical models have been published to describe this type of oscillation. On the other hand, relatively few theoretical studies have been proposed to give an explanation of complex intracellular calcium oscillations, such as bursting and chaos. In this paper, we develop a new possible mechanism for complex calcium oscillations based on the interplay between three calcium stores in the cell: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and cytosolic proteins. The majority ( approximately 80\%) of calcium released from the ER is first very quickly sequestered by mitochondria. Afterwards, a much slower release of calcium from the mitochondria serves as the calcium supply for the intermediate calcium exchanges between the ER and the cytosolic proteins causing bursting calcium oscillations. Depending on the permeability of the ER channels and on the kinetic properties of calcium binding to the cytosolic proteins, different patterns of complex calcium oscillations appear. With our model, we are able to explain simple calcium oscillations, bursting and chaos. Chaos is also observed for calcium oscillations in the bursting mode.},

@article{Gunter1990,
abstract = {It has been firmly established that the rapid uptake of Ca$^{2+}$ by mitochondria from a wide range of sources is mediated by a uniporter which permits transport of the ion down its electrochemical gradient. Several mechanisms of Ca$^{2+}$ efflux from mitochondria have also been extensively discussed in the literature. Energized mitochondria must expend a significant amount of energy to transport Ca$^{2+}$ against its electrochemical gradient from the matrix space to the external space. Two separate mechanisms have been found to mediate this outward transport: a Ca$^{2+}$/nNa$^+$ exchanger and a Na(+)-independent efflux mechanism. These efflux mechanisms are considered from the perspective of available energy. In addition, a reversible Ca2(+)-induced increase in inner membrane permeability can also occur. The induction of this permeability transition is characterized by swelling of the mitochondria, leakiness to small ions such as K$^+$, Mg2+, and Ca$^{2+}$, and loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. It has been suggested that the permeability transition and its reversal may also function as a mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ efflux mechanism under some conditions. The characteristics of each of these mechanisms are discussed, as well as their possible physiological functions.},

abstract = {EF-hand Ca$^{2+}$-binding proteins participate in both modulation of Ca$^{2+}$ signals and direct transduction of the ionic signal into downstream biochemical events. The range of biochemical functions of these proteins is correlated with differences in the way in which they respond to the binding of Ca$^{2+}$. The EF-hand domains of calbindin D(9k) and calmodulin are homologous, yet they respond to the binding of calcium ions in a drastically different manner. A series of comparative analyses of their structures enabled the development of hypotheses about which residues in these proteins control the calcium-induced changes in conformation. To test our understanding of the relationship between protein sequence and structure, we specifically designed the F36G mutation of the EF-hand protein calbindin D(9k) to alter the packing of helices I and II in the apoprotein. The three-dimensional structure of apo F36G was determined in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and showed that the design was successful. Surprisingly, significant structural perturbations also were found to extend far from the site of mutation. The observation of such long-range effects provides clear evidence that four-helix EF-hand domains should be treated as a single globally cooperative unit. A hypothetical mechanism for how the long-range effects are transmitted is described. Our results support the concept of energetic and structural coupling of the key residues that are crucial for a protein's fold and function.},

The genomic sequence provides access to the complete structures of all genes, including those without known function, their control elements, and, by inference, the proteins they encode, as well as all other biologically important sequences. Furthermore, the sequence is a rich and permanent source of information for the design of further biological studies of the organism and for the study of evolution through cross-species sequence comparison. The power of this approach has been amply demonstrated by the determination of the sequences of a number of microbial and model organisms. The next step is to obtain the complete sequence of the entire human genome. Here we report the sequence of the euchromatic part of human chromosome 22. The sequence obtained consists of 12 contiguous segments spanning 33.4 megabases, contains at least 545 genes and 134 pseudogenes, and provides the first view of the complex chromosomal landscapes that will be found in the rest of the genome.},

We construct a model of the IP(3) receptor and fit the model to dynamic and steady-state experimental data from type-2 IP(3) receptors. Our results indicate that, (i) Ca$^{2+}$ binds to the receptor using saturating, not mass-action, kinetics; (ii) Ca$^{2+}$ decreases the rate of IP(3) binding while simultaneously increasing the steady-state sensitivity of the receptor to IP(3); (iii) the rate of Ca$^{2+}$-induced receptor activation increases with Ca$^{2+}$ and is faster than Ca$^{2+}$-induced receptor inactivation; and (iv) IP(3) receptors are sequentially activated and inactivated by Ca$^{2+}$ even when IP(3) is bound. Our results emphasize that measurement of steady-state properties alone is insufficient to characterize the functional properties of the receptor.},

abstract = {NMDA receptors require both L-glutamate and the coagonist glycine for efficient channel activation. The glycine binding site of these heteromeric receptor proteins is formed by regions of the NMDAR1 (NR1) subunit that display sequence similarity to bacterial amino acid binding proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the glutamate binding site is located on the homologous regions of the NR2B subunit. Mutation of residues within the N-terminal domain and the loop region between membrane segments M3 and M4 significantly reduced the efficacy of glutamate, but not glycine, in channel gating. Some of the mutations also decreased inhibition by the glutamate antagonists, D-AP5 and R-CPP. Homology-based molecular modeling of the glutamate and glycine binding domains indicates that the NR2 and NR1 subunits use similar residues to ligate the agonists' alpha-aminocarboxylic acid groups, whereas differences in side chain interactions and size of aromatic residues determine ligand selectivity.},

Here we report the identification of a multifunctional sorting protein, PACS-2, that integrates ER-mitochondria communication, ER homeostasis, and apoptosis. PACS-2 controls the apposition of mitochondria with the ER, as depletion of PACS-2 causes BAP31-dependent mitochondria fragmentation and uncoupling from the ER. PACS-2 also controls formation of ER lipid-synthesizing centers found on mitochondria-associated membranes and ER homeostasis. However, in response to apoptotic inducers, PACS-2 translocates Bid to mitochondria, which initiates a sequence of events including the formation of mitochondrial truncated Bid, the release of cytochrome c, and the activation of caspase-3, thereby causing cell death. Together, our results identify PACS-2 as a novel sorting protein that links the ER-mitochondria axis to ER homeostasis and the control of cell fate, and provide new insights into Bid action.},

Similarly, relative positioning of two or more organelles is also important to perform certain specialized processes. Perhaps, the best-known form of interorganellar organization is that between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. Close communication between these two compartments has been observed for a long time. Recent evidence suggests that this is the basis for a bidirectional communication regulating a number of physiological processes ranging from mitochondrial energy and lipid metabolism to Ca$^{2+}$ signalling and cell death.

abstract = {While the oscillatory release of calcium from intracellular stores is comprised of fundamentally stochastic events, most models of calcium oscillations are deterministic. As a result, the transition to calcium oscillations as parameters, such as IP(3) concentration, are changed is not described correctly. The fundamental difficulty is that whole-cell models of calcium dynamics are based on the assumptions that the calcium concentration is spatially homogeneous, and that there are a sufficiently large number of release sites per unit volume so that the law of large numbers is applicable. For situations where these underlying assumptions are not applicable, a new modelling approach is needed. In this paper, we present a model and its analysis of calcium dynamics that incorporates the fundamental stochasticity of release events. The model is based on the assumptions that release events are rapid, while reactivation is slow. The model presented here is comprised of two parts. In the first, a stochastic version of the fire-diffuse-fire model is studied in order to understand the spark-to-wave transition and the probability of sparks resulting in abortive waves versus whole-cell calcium release. In the second, this information about the spark-to-wave transition is incorporated into a stochastic model (a Chapman-Kolmogorov equation) that tracks the number of activated and inactivated calcium release sites as a function of time. By solving this model numerically, information about the timing of whole-cell calcium release is obtained. The results of this analysis show a transition to oscillations that agrees well with data and with Monte Carlo simulations.},

Here, we take advantage of the molecular identification of the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter (MCU) and of unique targeted Ca$^{2+}$ probes to directly address this issue. We demonstrate that, during spontaneous Ca$^{2+}$ pacing, Ca$^{2+}$ peaks on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) are much greater than in the cytoplasm because of a large number of Ca$^{2+}$ hot spots generated on the OMM surface. Cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ peaks are reduced or enhanced by MCU overexpression and siRNA silencing, respectively; the opposite occurs within the mitochondrial matrix. Accordingly, the extent of contraction is reduced by overexpression of MCU and augmented by its down-regulation. Modulation of MCU levels does not affect the ATP content of the cardiomyocytes. Thus, in neonatal cardiac myocytes, mitochondria significantly contribute to buffering the amplitude of systolic Ca$^{2+}$ rises.},

abstract = {Mibefradil is a tetralol derivative that inhibits cloned and native T-type voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) at an IC50 of 1 microM and with an apparent 15-fold selectivity for T- over L-type VOCCs. Recent electrophysiological studies in Xenopus oocytes and inhibition of noradrenaline release studies in human isolated right atria concluded that mibefradil (0.3-3 microM) can block N-type VOCCs like omega-conotoxin GVIA. We tested this hypothesis in rat and guinea pig isolated driven left atria and rat vas deferens in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Mibefradil (3 microM) did not inhibit the inotropic responses to sympathetic electrical field stimulation in atria. In contrast, these responses were blocked by GVIA (10 nM) and tetrodotoxin (TTX 0.1 microM). In rat vas deferens, pretreated with benextramine (BNX 10 microM), contractions considered to be due to transmitter ATP evoked by electrical field stimulation were blocked by: (a) TTX 0.1 microM, (b) P2x receptor desensitisation (alphabeta-MeATP 100 microM), and (c) GVIA (pIC50 9.04+/-0.15, n=5). In contrast, mibefradil (0.3-30 microM) had no effect on these N-type VOCC-sensitive sympathetic nerve responses. Potassium (62 mM K$^+$) and alphabeta-MeATP-induced contractions were unaffected by GVIA (10 nM), but mibefradil inhibited the potassium-induced contractions with a pIC50 6.02+/-0.08 (n=5), consistent with a T- and L-type VOCC blocking action on the postjunctional smooth muscle. We conclude that mibefradil up to 30 microM does not block N-type VOCCs in these isolated intact tissue assays of sympathetic nerve-muscle transmission. Therefore, at least in these tissues, mibefradil can be used to define T- and L-type VOCC activities at submicromolar and micromolar concentrations in sympathetic nerve-mediated responses.},

Recently, these junctions have received attention because of their pivotal role in mediating calcium signal propagation to the mitochondria, which is important for both ATP production and mitochondrial cell death. Many of the SR/ER-mitochondrial calcium transporters and signaling proteins are sensitive to redox regulation and are directly exposed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in the mitochondria and SR/ER. Although ROS has been emerging as a novel signaling entity, the redox signaling of the SR/ER-mitochondrial interface is yet to be elucidated. We describe here possible mechanisms of the mutual interaction between local Ca$^{2+}$ and ROS signaling in the control of SR/ER-mitochondrial function.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) import is a well-described phenomenon regulating cell survival and ATP production. Of multiple pathways allowing such entry, the mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uniporter is a highly Ca$^{2+}$-selective channel complex encoded by several recently-discovered genes. However, the identity of the pore-forming subunit remains to be established, since knockdown of all the candidate uniporter genes inhibit Ca$^{2+}$ uptake in imaging assays, and reconstitution experiments have been equivocal. To definitively identify the channel, we use whole-mitoplast voltage-clamping, the technique that originally established the uniporter as a Ca$^{2+}$ channel. We show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) gene reduces mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ current (I MiCa ), whereas overexpression increases it. Additionally, a classic feature of I MiCa , its sensitivity to ruthenium red inhibition, can be abolished by a point mutation in the putative pore domain without altering current magnitude. These analyses establish that MCU encodes the pore-forming subunit of the uniporter channel. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00704.001.},

abstract = {BAX and BAK are "multidomain" proapoptotic proteins that initiate mitochondrial dysfunction but also localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for BAX and BAK (DKO cells) were found to have a reduced resting concentration of calcium in the ER ([Ca$^{2+}$]er) that results in decreased uptake of Ca$^{2+}$ by mitochondria after Ca$^{2+}$ release from the ER. Expression of SERCA (sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{2+}$ adenosine triphosphatase) corrected [Ca$^{2+}$]er and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake in DKO cells, restoring apoptotic death in response to agents that release Ca$^{2+}$ from intracellular stores (such as arachidonic acid, C2-ceramide, and oxidative stress). In contrast, targeting of BAX to mitochondria selectively restored apoptosis to "BH3-only" signals. A third set of stimuli, including many intrinsic signals, required both ER-released Ca$^{2+}$ and the presence of mitochondrial BAX or BAK to fully restore apoptosis. Thus, BAX and BAK operate in both the ER and mitochondria as an essential gateway for selected apoptotic signals.},

abstract = {Confocal microscope studies with fluorescent dyes of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-induced intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ mobilization recently established the existence of 'elementary' events, dependent on the activity of individual InsP3-sensitive Ca$^{2+}$ channels. In the present work, we try by theoretical stochastic simulation to explain the smallest signals observed in those studies, which were referred to as Ca$^{2+}$ 'blips' [Parker I., Yao Y. Ca$^{2+}$ transients associated with openings of inositol trisphosphate-gated channels in Xenopus oocytes. J Physiol Lond 1996; 491: 663-668]. For this purpose, we assumed a simple molecular model for the InsP3-sensitive Ca$^{2+}$ channel and defined a set of parameter values accounting for the results obtained in electrophysiological bilayer experiments [Bezprozvanny I., Watras J., Ehrlich B.E. Bell-shaped calcium-response curves of Ins(1,4,5)P3- and calcium-gated channels from endoplasmic reticulum of cerebellum. Nature 1991; 351: 751-754; Bezprozvanny I., Ehrlich B.E. Inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (InsP3)-gated Ca channels from cerebellum: conduction properties for divalent cations and regulation by intraluminal calcium. J Gen Physiol 1994; 104: 821-856]. With a stochastic procedure which considered cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ diffusion explicitly, we then simulated the behaviour of a single channel, placed in a realistic physiological environment. An attractive result was that the simulated channel exhibited bursts of activity, arising from repetitive channel openings, which were responsible for transient rises in Ca$^{2+}$ concentration and were reminiscent of the relatively long-duration experimental Ca$^{2+}$ blips. The influence of the values chosen for the various parameters (affinity and diffusion coefficient of the buffers, luminal Ca$^{2+}$ concentration) on the kinetic characteristics of these theoretical blips is analyzed.},

Fertilization provides a potent mitogenic stimulus, and the zygote enters the cell cycle repeatedly and is rapidly transformed into a multicellular embryo. As development proceeds and the number of cells in the embryo increases, groups of cells are progressively apportioned distinct fates through a process of cell specification .},

The release events were dissimilar to the sparks and puffs described so far, as many arose from clusters of both ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs). Increasing either the stimulus strength or loading of the intracellular stores enhanced the frequency of and coupling between elementary release sites and evoked global Ca$^{2+}$ signals. In the PC12 cells, the elementary Ca$^{2+}$ release preferentially occurred around the branch points. Spatio-temporal recruitment of such elementary release events may regulate neuronal activities.},

abstract = {Calcium is an important signaling molecule involved in the regulation of many cellular functions. The large free energy in the Ca$^{2+}$ ion membrane gradients makes Ca$^{2+}$ signaling inherently sensitive to the available cellular free energy, primarily in the form of ATP. In addition, Ca$^{2+}$ regulates many cellular ATP-consuming reactions such as muscle contraction, exocytosis, biosynthesis, and neuronal signaling. Thus, Ca$^{2+}$ becomes a logical candidate as a signaling molecule for modulating ATP hydrolysis and synthesis during changes in numerous forms of cellular work. Mitochondria are the primary source of aerobic energy production in mammalian cells and also maintain a large Ca$^{2+}$ gradient across their inner membrane, providing a signaling potential for this molecule. The demonstrated link between cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations, identification of transport mechanisms, and the proximity of mitochondria to Ca$^{2+}$ release sites further supports the notion that Ca$^{2+}$ can be an important signaling molecule in the energy metabolism interplay of the cytosol with the mitochondria. Here we review sites within the mitochondria where Ca$^{2+}$ plays a role in the regulation of ATP generation and potentially contributes to the orchestration of cellular metabolic homeostasis. Early work on isolated enzymes pointed to several matrix dehydrogenases that are stimulated by Ca$^{2+}$, which were confirmed in the intact mitochondrion as well as cellular and in vivo systems. However, studies in these intact systems suggested a more expansive influence of Ca$^{2+}$ on mitochondrial energy conversion. Numerous noninvasive approaches monitoring NADH, mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption, and workloads suggest significant effects of Ca$^{2+}$ on other elements of NADH generation as well as downstream elements of oxidative phosphorylation, including the F(1)F(O)-ATPase and the cytochrome chain. These other potential elements of Ca$^{2+}$ modification of mitochondrial energy conversion will be the focus of this review. Though most specific molecular mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, it is clear that Ca$^{2+}$ provides a balanced activation of mitochondrial energy metabolism that exceeds the alteration of dehydrogenases alone.},

Experiments conducted inrecent years unraveled its structure and enabled the recognition of basic cellular functions. Despite an undoubtedly tremendous progress in the characterization of p66Shc, mechanisms through which this protein potentially impacts the metabolism of mitochondria, and thus the cellular energetics are still waiting to be elucidated. Particularly interesting and profoundly studied is the concept that p66Shc may be a key component of the cell response to oxidative stress which may effectively contribute to the lifespan of the organism. p66Shc phosphorylation at serine 36 triggers a cascade of events leading to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The widely accepted free radical theory of ageing, proposed by Harman inthe - 1950s, assumes that an uncontrolled increase of ROS may lead to oxidation of fundamental cellular components such as proteins and phospholipids even sometimes premature dand cause DNA damage. Accumulation of such lesions in cells may unfavorably affect the functions of tissues and organs, leading to pathologies oreath of the organism. Although well experimentally established, knowledge regarding the involvement of the p66Shc protein in the production of ROS and its impact on the lifespan of organisms remains insufficient and requires a lot of additional research. Further investigation will permit a better understanding ofthe mechanisms governing the processes o f aging andthe emergence of variouspathologies associated with oxidative stress. This work is an attempt to systematize the existing knowledge about the p66Shc protein structure and functions. Another objective was to draw attention to the most interesting aspects and results of in vivo and in vitro studies in different models in the context of oxidative stress-associated pathologies and in aging.},

abstract = {All eukaryotic cells import Ca$^{2+}$ through a number of variously gated plasma membrane channels. Once inside cells, Ca$^{2+}$ transmits information to a large number of (enzyme) targets. Eventually, it must be exported again, to prevent the overloading of the cytosol with Ca$^{2+}$. Two systems export Ca$^{2+}$ from cells: a high affinity, low capacity Ca$^{2+}$-ATPase, and a lower affinity, but much larger capacity, Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger. The ATPase (commonly called the Ca$^{2+}$ pump) is the fine-tuner of cell Ca$^{2+}$, as it functions well even if the concentration of the ion drops below the microM level. It is a large enzyme, with 10 transmembrane domains and a C-terminal cytosolic tail that contains regulatory sites, including a calmodulin-binding domain. Four distinct gene products plus a large number of splice variants have been described. Some are tissue specific, the isoform 2 being specifically expressed in the sensorial cells of the Corti organ in the inner-ear. Its genetic absence causes deafness in mice. Two different families of the Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ exchanger exist, one of which, originally described in photoreceptors, transports K$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ in exchange for Na$^+$. The exchanger is particularly active in excitable cells, e.g., heart, where the necessity cyclically arises to rapidly eject large amounts of Ca$^{2+}$. In addition to heart, the exchanger is particularly important to neurons: the cleavage of the most important neuronal isoform (NCX3) by calpains activated by excitotoxic treatments generates Ca$^{2+}$ overload and eventually cell death.},

abstract = {A simplified mechanism that mimics "adaptation" of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) has been developed and its significance for Ca$^{2+}$(-)induced Ca$^{2+}$ release and Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations investigated. For parameters that reproduce experimental data for the RyR from cardiac cells, adaptation of the RyR in combination with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{2+}$ ATPase Ca$^{2+}$ pumps in the internal stores can give rise to either low [Cai2+] steady states or Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations coexisting with unphysiologically high [Cai2+] steady states. In this closed-cell-type model rapid, adaptation-dependent Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations occur only in limited ranges of parameters. In the presence of Ca$^{2+}$ influx and efflux from outside the cell (open-cell model) Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations occur for a wide range of physiological parameter values and have a period that is determined by the rate of Ca$^{2+}$ refilling of the stores. Although the rate of adaptation of the RyR has a role in determining the shape and the period of the Ca$^{2+}$ spike, it is not essential for their existence. This is in marked contrast with what is observed for the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor for which the biphasic activation and inhibition of its activity by Ca$^{2+}$ are sufficient to produce oscillations. Results for this model are compared with those based on Ca$^{2+}$(-)induced Ca$^{2+}$ release alone in the bullfrog sympathetic neuron. This kinetic model should be suitable for analyzing phenomena associated with "Ca$^{2+}$ sparks," including their merger into Ca$^{2+}$ waves in cardiac myocytes.},

abstract = {Resting mitochondrial matrix Ca$^{2+}$ is maintained through a mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1)-established threshold inhibition of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) activity. It is not known how MICU1 interacts with MCU to establish this Ca$^{2+}$ threshold for mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ uptake and MCU activity. Here, we show that MICU1 localizes to the mitochondrial matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and MICU1/MCU binding is determined by a MICU1 N-terminal polybasic domain and two interacting coiled-coil domains of MCU. Further investigation reveals that MICU1 forms homo-oligomers, and this oligomerization is independent of the polybasic region. However, the polybasic region confers MICU1 oligomeric binding to MCU and controls mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ current (IMCU). Moreover, MICU1 EF hands regulate MCU channel activity, but do not determine MCU binding. Loss of MICU1 promotes MCU activation leading to oxidative burden and a halt to cell migration. These studies establish a molecular mechanism for MICU1 control of MCU-mediated mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ accumulation, and dysregulation of this mechanism probably enhances vascular dysfunction.},

@article{Wingrove1984,
abstract = {It has been widely reported that the in vivo administration of glucagon to rats results in the stimulation of calcium influx in subsequently isolated liver mitochondria. The mechanism of this effect is investigated through simultaneous measurements of calcium uptake rate and mitochondrial membrane potential. This allows the measurement of the calcium uniporter conductance independent of hormonal effects on electron transport or respiration. Two experimental approaches are used. The first involves measuring the uptake of 40-50 nmol of Ca$^{2+}$/mg of mitochondrial protein with the calcium dye antipyrylazo III; the second uses 45Ca$^{2+}$ to follow uptake in the presence of 0.5 to 1.5 microM free calcium, buffered with HEDTA. In both cases a tetraphenyl phosphonium electrode is used to follow membrane potential, and membrane potential is varied using either malonate or butylmalonate in the presence of rotenone. The relative merits of these two approaches are discussed. The conductance of the calcium uniporter is found not to be stimulated by glucagon pretreatment. Also, the relative glucagon stimulation of both calcium influx and membrane potential is found to increase with increasing malonate concentration. These results imply that there is no direct stimulation of calcium uptake into liver mitochondria following glucagon treatment. The results are consistent with a glucagon stimulation of substrate transport, substrate oxidation, or a stimulation of electron transport resulting in an increased membrane potential and secondary stimulation of calcium uptake.},

abstract = {1. The action of mibefradil was studied on wild type class A calcium (Ca$^{2+}$) channels and various class A/L-type channel chimaeras expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The mechanism of Ca$^{2+}$ channel block by mibefradil was evaluated with two microelectrode voltage clamp. 2. Resting-state dependent block (or initial block) of barium currents (IBa) through class A Ca$^{2+}$ channels was concentration dependent with an IC50 value of 208+/-23 microM. 3. Mibefradil (50 microM) did not significantly affect the midpoint voltage of the steady-state inactivation curve suggesting that inactivation does not promote Ca$^{2+}$ channel block. Chimaeric class A/L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels inactivating with faster or slower kinetics than wild type class A channels were equally well inhibited by mibefradil as wild type class A channels. 4. Frequent Ca$^{2+}$ channel activation facilitated IBa inhibition by mibefradil (use-dependent block). Recovery from use-dependent block was voltage-dependent, being slower at depolarized membrane potentials (tau = 75+/-15 s at -70 mV, (n=6) vs tau = 20+/-2 s at -100 mV, (n=6), P<0.05). 5. We suggest that use-dependent block of class A Ca$^{2+}$ channels by mibefradil occurs because of slow recovery from open channel block (SROB) and not because of drug binding to inactivated channels. 6. Voltage-dependent slow recovery from open state-dependent block provides a molecular basis for understanding the cardiovascular profile of mibefradil such as selectivity for vasculature and relative lack of negative inotropic effects.},

@article{Tikunov2010,
abstract = {The electron transport chain of mitochondria is a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play a critical role in augmenting the Ca$^{2+}$-induced mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Mitochondrial release of superoxide anions (O(2)(-)) from the intermembrane space (IMS) to the cytosol is mediated by voltage dependent anion channels (VDAC) in the outer membrane. Here, we examined whether closure of VDAC increases intramitochondrial oxidative stress by blocking efflux of O(2)(-) from the IMS and sensitizing to the Ca$^{2+}$-induced MPT. Treatment of isolated rat liver mitochondria with 5microM G3139, an 18-mer phosphorothioate blocker of VDAC, accelerated onset of the MPT by 6.8+/-1.4min within a range of 100-250microM Ca$^{2+}$. G3139-mediated acceleration of the MPT was reversed by 20microM butylated hydroxytoluene, a water soluble antioxidant. Pre-treatment of mitochondria with G3139 also increased accumulation of O(2)(-) in mitochondria, as monitored by dihydroethidium fluorescence, and permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane with digitonin reversed the effect of G3139 on O(2)(-) accumulation. Mathematical modeling of generation and turnover of O(2)(-) within the IMS indicated that closure of VDAC produces a 1.55-fold increase in the steady-state level of mitochondrial O(2)(-). In conclusion, closure of VDAC appears to impede the efflux of superoxide anions from the IMS, resulting in an increased steady-state level of O(2)(-), which causes an internal oxidative stress and sensitizes mitochondria toward the Ca$^{2+}$-induced MPT.},

@article{Tsujimoto2007,
abstract = {In recent years, the role of the mitochondria in both apoptotic and necrotic cell death has received considerable attention. An increase of mitochondrial membrane permeability is one of the key events in apoptotic or necrotic death, although the details of the mechanism involved remain to be elucidated. The mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT) is a Ca$^{2+}$-dependent increase of mitochondrial membrane permeability that leads to loss of Deltapsi, mitochondrial swelling, and rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The MPT is thought to occur after the opening of a channel that is known as the permeability transition pore (PTP), which putatively consists of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), cyclophilin D (Cyp D: a mitochondrial peptidyl prolyl-cis, trans-isomerase), and other molecule(s). Recently, significant progress has been made by studies performed with mice lacking Cyp D at several laboratories, which have convincingly demonstrated that Cyp D is essential for the MPT to occur and that the Cyp D-dependent MPT regulates some forms of necrotic, but not apoptotic, cell death. Cyp D-deficient mice have also been used to show that the Cyp D-dependent MPT plays a crucial role in ischemia/reperfusion injury. The anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) have the ability to block the MPT, and can therefore block MPT-dependent necrosis in addition to their well-established ability to inhibit apoptosis.},

@article{Gunter2004,
abstract = {The literature suggests that the physiological functions for which mitochondria sequester Ca$^{2+}$ are (1). to stimulate and control the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, (2). to induce the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and perhaps apoptotic cell death, and (3). to modify the shape of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ pulses or transients. There is strong evidence that intramitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ controls both the rate of ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation and induction of the MPT. Since the results of these processes are so divergent, the signals inducing them must not be ambiguous. Furthermore, as pointed out by Balaban [J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 34 (2002 ) 11259-11271], for any repetitive physiological process dependent on intramitochondrial free Ca$^{2+}$ concentration ([Ca$^{2+}$](m)), a kind of intramitochondrial homeostasis must exist so that Ca$^{2+}$ influx during the pulse is matched by Ca$^{2+}$ efflux during the period between pulses to avoid either Ca$^{2+}$ buildup or depletion. In addition, mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport modifies both spatial and temporal aspects of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling. Here, we look at the amounts of Ca$^{2+}$ necessary to mediate the functions of mitochondrial Ca$^{2+}$ transport and at the mechanisms of transport themselves in order to set up a hypothesis about how the mechanisms carry out their roles. The emphasis here is on isolated mitochondria and on general mitochondrial properties in order to focus on how mitochondria alone may function to fulfill their physiological roles even though the interactions of mitochondria with other organelles, particularly with endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum [Sci. STKE re1 (2004) 1-9], may also influence this story.},

abstract = {bcl-x is a member of the bcl-2 family of genes. The major protein product, Bcl-x(L), is a 233-amino-acid protein which has antiapoptotic properties. In contrast, one of the alternatively spliced transcripts of the bcl-x gene codes for the protein Bcl-x(S), which lacks 63 amino acids present in Bcl-x(L) and has proapoptotic activity. Unlike other proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such as Bax and Bak, Bcl-x(S) does not seem to induce cell death in the absence of an additional death signal. However, Bcl-x(S) does interfere with the ability of Bcl-x(L) to antagonize Bax-induced death in transiently transfected 293 cells. Mutational analysis of Bcl-x(S) was conducted to identify the domains necessary to mediate its proapoptotic phenotype. Deletion mutants of Bcl-x(S) which still contained an intact BH3 domain retained the ability to inhibit survival through antagonism of Bcl-x(L). Bcl-x(S) was able to form heterodimers with Bcl-x(L) in mammalian cells, and its ability to inhibit survival correlated with the ability to heterodimerize with Bcl-x(L). Deletion mutants of Bax and Bcl-2, which lacked BH1 and BH2 domains but contained a BH3 domain, were able to antagonize the survival effect conferred by Bcl-x(L). The results suggest that BH3 domains from both pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, while lacking an intrinsic ability to promote programmed cell death, can be potent inhibitors of Bcl-x(L) survival function.},
