abstract = {The Ca(2+) ion serves as a ubiquitous second messenger in eukaryotic cells and changes in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration regulate many responses within a cell, but also communication between cells. In order to make use of such an apparently simple signal, i.e. a change in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, cells are equipped with sophisticated machinery to precisely regulate the shape (amplitude, duration) of Ca(2+) signals in a localization-specific manner. To ascertain such a precise regulation, cells rely on the components of the Ca(2+) signaling toolkit. This embraces Ca(2+) entry systems including Ca(2+) channels in the plasma membrane and organellar membranes, and Ca(2+) extrusion/uptake systems including Ca(2+)-ATPases (Ca(2+) pumps) and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers. Besides mitochondria, organelles implicated also in Ca(2+) signaling, cytosolic Ca(2+) buffers are cell-specific subtle modulators of Ca(2+) signals. The Ca(2+)-signaling components not only orchestrate their activity as to ascertain the high accuracy of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling, but they are also implicated in the regulation of their own expression. The total of the molecules that build the network of Ca(2+) signaling components, and that are involved in their own regulation as to maintain physiological Ca(2+) homeostasis resulting in phenotypic stability is named the Ca(2+) homeostasome. Mechanistic details on the functioning of the Ca(2+) homeostasome are presented.},

abstract = {The function and efficiency of cell signalling pathways are very dependent on their organization both in space and time. With regard to spatial organization, signalling components are highly organized with respect to their cellular location and how they transmit information from one region of the cell to another. This spatial organization of signalling pathways depends on the molecular interactions that occur between signalling components that use signal transduction domains to construct signalling pathways. Very often, the components responsible for information transfer mechanisms are held in place by being attached to scaffolding proteins to form macromolecular signalling complexes . Sometimes these macromolecular complexes can be organized further by being localized to specific regions of the cell, as found in lipid rafts and caveolae or in the T-tubule regions of skeletal and cardiac cells.10.1042/csb0001006},

abstract = {Calcium (Ca2+) is a versatile second messenger that regulates a wide range of cellular functions. Although it is not established how a single second messenger coordinates diverse effects within a cell, there is increasing evidence that the spatial patterns of Ca2+ signals may determine their specificity. Ca2+ signaling patterns can vary in different regions of the cell and Ca2+ signals in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments have been reported to occur independently. No general paradigm has been established yet to explain whether, how, or when Ca2+ signals are initiated within the nucleus or their function. Here we highlight that receptor tyrosine kinases rapidly translocate to the nucleus. Ca2+ signals that are induced by growth factors result from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation within the nucleus rather than within the cytoplasm. This novel signaling mechanism may be responsible for growth factor effects on cell proliferation.},

Each specialized cell type has developed control mechanisms to suit their particular functions. For example, skeletal and cardiac muscle cells have very rapid signalling mechanisms capable of driving contraction within milliseconds. Smooth muscle cells tend to act more slowly, and are far more diverse in both their function and control mechanisms. Some cells contract in a conventional way in response to an external agonist, while others have more complex control mechanisms responsible for maintaining the tonic contraction of the smooth muscle cells surrounding blood vessels.},

abstract = {Cells have intrinsic signalling mechanisms that are capable of sensing various deleterious conditions, both normal and pathological, and respond by mounting a variety of stress responses. Examples of normal signals are the cytokines that induce inflammatory responses in cells. Pathological signals include UV and X-ray irradiation, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), abrupt anoxia and physicochemical injury through heat or noxious chemicals. A process of wound healing can function to repair the damage caused by such injuries. In many cases, especially if the stress signal is not too severe, the cell can survive and can even become tolerant to further insults. If cells are growing, such sub-lethal insults can either cause the cell to stop growing temporarily to allow adequate time to repair the damage, or the process of cell proliferation can be stopped more permanently and the cell will enter a state of senescence . Another example of an evolutionarily conserved survival mechanism is autophagy , which enables cells to cope with periods of starvation. If such stresses become too severe, however, the cell dies, either through a process of necrosis, which is rapid and catastrophic, or through a slower and more controlled process that is carried out by a highly regulated process of programmed cell death known as apoptosis .},

In most cases, proliferation is mediated by growth factors operating within a highly localized environment so that only those cells in the immediate vicinity are instructed to grow. To understand how growth factors control cell proliferation, we have to consider both the nature of the signalling mechanisms and how they impinge upon the cell cycle machinery that regulates cell growth and cell division.

abstract = {BAX and BAK are "multidomain" proapoptotic proteins that initiate mitochondrial dysfunction but also localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for BAX and BAK (DKO cells) were found to have a reduced resting concentration of calcium in the ER ([Ca2+]er) that results in decreased uptake of Ca2+ by mitochondria after Ca2+ release from the ER. Expression of SERCA (sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase) corrected [Ca2+]er and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in DKO cells, restoring apoptotic death in response to agents that release Ca2+ from intracellular stores (such as arachidonic acid, C2-ceramide, and oxidative stress). In contrast, targeting of BAX to mitochondria selectively restored apoptosis to "BH3-only" signals. A third set of stimuli, including many intrinsic signals, required both ER-released Ca2+ and the presence of mitochondrial BAX or BAK to fully restore apoptosis. Thus, BAX and BAK operate in both the ER and mitochondria as an essential gateway for selected apoptotic signals.},

Within each region, neurons are connected to each other to form neural circuits of bewildering complexity. To function in such circuits, each neuron must receive and process information entering from one set of neurons and then relay signals to other neurons in the circuit. The neuronal processes of signal reception and transmission are key elements of neuronal function and are located at opposite ends of the neuron. Specific attention will be focused on the operation of neural circuits in regions such as the hippocampus , cortex , cerebellum and the respiratory cent re in the brainstem. Neural circuits are established during development and remain relatively constant throughout adult life. The only exception in humans is the hippocampus, where the neuronal elements of the circuit are constantly being replaced by a process of neurogenesis .},

abstract = {Mammalian Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are members of three branches of a much larger family of transport proteins [the CaCA (Ca2+/cation antiporter) superfamily] whose main role is to provide control of Ca2+ flux across the plasma membranes or intracellular compartments. Since cytosolic levels of Ca2+ are much lower than those found extracellularly or in sequestered stores, the major function of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers is to extrude Ca2+ from the cytoplasm. The exchangers are, however, fully reversible and thus, under special conditions of subcellular localization and compartmentalized ion gradients, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers may allow Ca2+ entry and may play more specialized roles in Ca2+ movement between compartments. The NCX (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger) [SLC (solute carrier) 8] branch of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers comprises three members: NCX1 has been most extensively studied, and is broadly expressed with particular abundance in heart, brain and kidney, NCX2 is expressed in brain, and NCX3 is expressed in brain and skeletal muscle. The NCX proteins subserve a variety of roles, depending upon the site of expression. These include cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, neuronal signalling and Ca2+ reabsorption in the kidney. The NCKX (Na2+/Ca2+-K+ exchanger) (SLC24) branch of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers transport K+ and Ca2+ in exchange for Na+, and comprises five members: NCKX1 is expressed in retinal rod photoreceptors, NCKX2 is expressed in cone photoreceptors and in neurons throughout the brain, NCKX3 and NCKX4 are abundant in brain, but have a broader tissue distribution, and NCKX5 is expressed in skin, retinal epithelium and brain. The NCKX proteins probably play a particularly prominent role in regulating Ca2+ flux in environments which experience wide and frequent fluctuations in Na+ concentration. Until recently, the range of functions that NCKX proteins play was generally underappreciated. This situation is now changing rapidly as evidence emerges for roles including photoreceptor adaptation, synaptic plasticity and skin pigmentation. The CCX (Ca2+/cation exchanger) branch has only one mammalian member, NCKX6 or NCLX (Na+/Ca2+-Li+ exchanger), whose physiological function remains unclear, despite a broad pattern of expression.},

abstract = {Fertilization calcium waves are introduced, and the evidence from which we can infer general mechanisms of these waves is presented. The two main classes of hypotheses put forward to explain the generation of the fertilization calcium wave are set out, and it is concluded that initiation of the fertilization calcium wave can be most generally explained in invertebrates by a mechanism in which an activating substance enters the egg from the sperm on sperm-egg fusion, activating the egg by stimulating phospholipase C activation through a src family kinase pathway and in mammals by the diffusion of a sperm-specific phospholipase C from sperm to egg on sperm-egg fusion. The fertilization calcium wave is then set into the context of cell cycle control, and the mechanism of repetitive calcium spiking in mammalian eggs is investigated. Evidence that calcium signals control cell division in early embryos is reviewed, and it is concluded that calcium signals are essential at all three stages of cell division in early embryos. Evidence that phosphoinositide signaling pathways control the resumption of meiosis during oocyte maturation is considered. It is concluded on balance that the evidence points to a need for phosphoinositide/calcium signaling during resumption of meiosis. Changes to the calcium signaling machinery occur during meiosis to enable the production of a calcium wave in the mature oocyte when it is fertilized; evidence that the shape and structure of the endoplasmic reticulum alters dynamically during maturation and after fertilization is reviewed, and the link between ER dynamics and the cytoskeleton is discussed. There is evidence that calcium signaling plays a key part in the development of patterning in early embryos. Morphogenesis in ascidian, frog, and zebrafish embryos is briefly described to provide the developmental context in which calcium signals act. Intracellular calcium waves that may play a role in axis formation in ascidian are discussed. Evidence that the Wingless/calcium signaling pathway is a strong ventralizing signal in Xenopus, mediated by phosphoinositide signaling, is adumbrated. The central role that calcium channels play in morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and in ectodermal and mesodermal gene expression during late gastrulation is demonstrated. Experiments in zebrafish provide a strong indication that calcium signals are essential for pattern formation and organogenesis.},

abstract = {Cells use a large number of clearly defined signalling pathways to regulate their activity. In this module, attention is focused on the On mechanisms responsible for transmitting information into the cell. These signalling pathways fall into two main groups depending on how they are activated. Most of them are activated by external stimuli and function to transfer information from the cell surface to internal effector systems. However, some of the signalling systems respond to information generated from within the cell, usually in the form of metabolic messengers . For all of these signalling pathways, information is conveyed either through protein–protein interactions or it is transmitted by diffusible elements usually referred to as second messengers. Cells often employ a number of these signalling pathways, and cross-talk between them is an important feature. In this section, attention is focused on the properties of the major intracellular signalling pathways operating in cells to regulate their cellular activity.},

@article{Griffiths2009,
abstract = {Mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport was initially considered important only in buffering of cytosolic Ca(2+) by acting as a "sink" under conditions of Ca(2+) overload. The main regulator of ATP production was considered to be the relative concentrations of high energy phosphates. However, work by Denton and McCormack in the 1970s and 1980s showed that free intramitochondrial Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](m)) activated dehydrogenase enzymes in mitochondria, leading to increased NADH and hence ATP production. This leads them to propose a scheme, subsequently termed a "parallel activation model" whereby increases in energy demand, such as hormonal stimulation or increased workload in muscle, produced an increase in cytosolic [Ca(2+)] that was relayed by the mitochondrial Ca(2+) transporters into the matrix to give an increase in [Ca(2+)](m). This then stimulated energy production to meet the increased energy demand. With the development of methods for measuring [Ca(2+)](m) in living cells that proved [Ca(2+)](m) changed over a dynamic physiological range rather than simply soaking up excess cytosolic [Ca(2+)], this model has now gained widespread acceptance. However, work by ourselves and others using targeted probes to measure changes in both [Ca(2+)] and [ATP] in different cell compartments has revealed variations in the interrelationships between these two in different tissues, suggesting that metabolic regulation by Ca(2+) is finely tuned to the demands and function of the individual organ.},

@article{Denton2009,
abstract = {Studies in Bristol in the 1960s and 1970s, led to the recognition that four mitochondrial dehydrogenases are activated by calcium ions. These are FAD-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. FAD-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase is located on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is influenced by changes in cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration. The other three enzymes are located within mitochondria and are regulated by changes in mitochondrial matrix calcium ion concentration. These and subsequent studies on purified enzymes, mitochondria and intact cell preparations have led to the widely accepted view that the activation of these enzymes is important in the stimulation of the respiratory chain and hence ATP supply under conditions of increased ATP demand in many stimulated mammalian cells. The effects of calcium ions on FAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase involve binding to an EF-hand binding motif within this enzyme but the binding sites involved in the effects of calcium ions on the three intramitochondrial dehydrogenases remain to be fully established. It is also emphasised in this article that these three dehydrogenases appear only to be regulated by calcium ions in vertebrates and that this raises some interesting and potentially important developmental issues.},

abstract = {Signalling pathways are composed of the ON mechanisms that generate internal signals and the OFF mechanism that remove these signals as cells recover from stimulation. Most attention will be focused on how second messengers and their downstream effectors are inactivated. The second messengers cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP are inactivated by phosphodiesterase (PDE) . Inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) metabolism is carried out by both inositol trisphosphatase and inositol phosphatases. Diacylglycerol (DAG) metabolism occurs through two enzyme systems, DAG kinase and DAG lipase. In the case of Ca2+ signalling, recovery is carried out by the Ca2+ pumps and exchangers that remove Ca2+ from the cytoplasm. The mitochondria also play an important role in Ca2+ homoeostasis. Many of these second messengers activate downstream effectors through protein phosphorylation, and these activation events are reversed by corresponding protein phosphatases .},

@article{Gonzalez-Garcia2013,
abstract = {Fertilization of mammalian eggs is characterized by a series of Ca(2+) oscillations triggered by a phospholipase C activity. These Ca(2+) increases and the parallel generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) stimulate protein kinase C (PKC). However, the dynamics of PKC activity have not been directly measured in living eggs. Here, we have monitored the dynamics of PKC-induced phosphorylation in mouse eggs, alongside Ca(2+) oscillations, using fluorescent C-kinase activity reporter (CKAR) probes. Ca(2+) oscillations triggered either by sperm, phospholipase C zeta (PLC$\zeta$) or Sr(2+) all caused repetitive increases in PKC-induced phosphorylation, as detected by CKAR in the cytoplasm or plasma membrane. The CKAR responses lasted for several minutes in both the cytoplasm and plasma membrane then returned to baseline values before subsequent Ca(2+) transients. High frequency oscillations caused by PLC$\zeta$ led to an integration of PKC-induced phosphorylation. The conventional PKC inhibitor, G\"{o}6976, could inhibit CKAR increases in response to thapsigargin or ionomycin, but not the repetitive responses seen at fertilization. Repetitive increases in PKC$\delta$ activity were also detected during Ca(2+) oscillations using an isoform-specific $\delta$CKAR. However, PKC$\delta$ may already be mostly active in unfertilized eggs, since phorbol esters were effective at stimulating $\delta$CKAR only after fertilization, and the PKC$\delta$-specific inhibitor, rottlerin, decreased the CKAR signals in unfertilized eggs. These data show that PKC-induced phosphorylation outlasts each Ca(2+) increase in mouse eggs but that signal integration only occurs at a non-physiological, high Ca(2+) oscillation frequency. The results also suggest that Ca(2+) -induced DAG formation on intracellular membranes may stimulate PKC activity oscillations at fertilization.},
